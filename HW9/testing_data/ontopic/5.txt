Dear Campus Community,  
 
It is with great sadness that I must announce the loss of a fellow Monarch. Marishika Foster passed away on September 29, 2021. Marishika was a graduate student in the Strome College of Business.  Marishika is survived by her husband, children, grandchildren, mother, and stepfather. I know you join me in extending to Marishika’s family and friends our most sincere condolences during this difficult time.  
 
Old Dominion’s Counseling Center is available to students, faculty, and staff who are having difficulty. You may call to make an appointment with Counseling Services or to receive immediate counseling via telephone call 757-683-4401 and select option 2.  

Sincerely,  

 

don
