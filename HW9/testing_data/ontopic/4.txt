Dear Monarch Community:

 

As the federal government focuses on expanding COVID-19 booster shots to protect us against the new Omicron variant, I wanted to remind you that the University is making boosters available to you on campus. Boosters are being administered at the Jim Jarrett Annex, which is next to the new Chemistry Building.  

 

To schedule a booster shot, go to the Monarch Wellness Portal at https://odu.medicatconnect.com/home.aspx, click on the “Appts” tab at the top of the screen and then on the “COVID 19 Vaccine Clinic” option under “Locations.” Walk-in appointments are also available, on a first-come, first-served basis. 

 

As employees and students of a Virginia institution of higher education, ALL faculty, staff and students ages 18 years and older are eligible to receive a booster shot either 6 months after their initial Pfizer or Moderna series or 2 months after their initial Johnson & Johnson vaccine. 

 

The clinic also continues to provide the first two COVID-19 vaccines for everyone in the Monarch community.  

 

Pfizer shots and boosters are available on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and Moderna and Johnson & Johnson on Tuesdays and Thursdays. You are encouraged to wear loose clothing with easy access to your upper arm. 

 

In addition, Old Dominion continues to provide COVID-19 testing to faculty, staff and students. If you would like to get tested before the winter holiday break, you can schedule an appointment (this short video walks you through scheduling a testing appointment). Walk-in appointments will be provided based on availability. 

 

Do not come in for a test if you tested positive for COVID within the previous 90 days. 

 

I encourage you to take advantage of these services as we continue to #ReignResponsibly and work together to protect the health and safety of our Monarch community. For more information, visit odu.edu/covid19 or contact Student Health Services at studenthealth@odu.edu or 757-683-3132. I wish all of you an enjoyable rest of the semester. 

 

Regards,

 

Giovanna
