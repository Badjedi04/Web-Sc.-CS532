Dear Colleagues:

 

I want to call your attention to the email below from VP Ashley Schumaker about the University strategic plan.  Comments have been invited during this 30-day comment period, ending November 3.  I have attached a PDF of the draft working document, which is also available at the link in the message below.  I strongly urge you to read the draft carefully and send comments to VP Schumaker by Nov. 3 at 5 pm.  This is an important opportunity for all of us to help shape the investments that ODU will make over the next five years.

 

In the spring we will launch a process to produce a college strategic plan that aligns with the University plan.  I welcome suggestions for how that process should be organized.

 

Best Regards,

Gail
