VISA Status Check and Travel Signature Day

Spring 2023 Travel Signature Day is around the corner! Are you planning to travel over the summer break? Be sure to come to our Spring Travel Signature Day on


Thursday, April 20th from 10 am to 3 pm, in Dragas 2006 and get a travel signature!




✈Travel signatures on the spot:

If you are on an F or J visa issued by ODU, you (and your dependents) will need a travel signature on your visa document in order to re-enter the U.S. after any summer travel.





Note: The VISA office recommends that your travel signature be no more than 6 months prior to your date of re-entry (i.e. if you plan on returning to the US on August 1st, you should have a travel signature issued on or after February 1st). Please check the date of the most recent signature on your document to determine if you need a new travel signature (See above photo for locations of travel signatures.)




 What to bring: 

- Passport/Visa stamp

- Current I-20 or DS-2019

- Dependent Documents

 

✈Not traveling over the summer? Please feel free to come for a review of your documents and SEVIS record.
