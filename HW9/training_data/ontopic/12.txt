Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff:

 

Following a year-long comprehensive process outlined by President Brian O. Hemphill, Ph.D. and on behalf of the Strategic Planning Steering Committee, the 2023-2028 Strategic Plan (in the form of a DRAFT WORKING COPY) is being shared with the campus community for a 30-day comment period.  The plan is available on the Universityâ€™s website at https://www.odu.edu/about/planning with a direct document link of https://www.odu.edu/content/dam/odu/units/strategicplan/docs/strategic-planning-2023/2023-2028-strategic-plan-draft-working-copy-for-campus-comment-period-10-4-22%20.pdf.

 

Any and all feedback should be submitted to me at aschumak@odu.edu by 5:00 PM on Thursday, November 3, 2022.  Provided feedback will be reviewed by the Steering Committee with plan changes to be made prior to the December 2022 meetings of the Board of Visitors.

 

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me or the Steering Committee Co-Chairs, Austin Agho, Ph.D. at aagho@odu.edu and/or Suzanne Wright, Ph.D. at swright@odu.edu.  We appreciate your direct engagement in this important and ongoing process!

 

Sincerely,
