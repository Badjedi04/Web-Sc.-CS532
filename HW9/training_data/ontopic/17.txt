Dear Campus Community,    
   


I regret that I must announce the loss of a fellow Monarch. Corey Sargent passed away on June 11, 2022.  
 
Corey was a PhD student in Physics who completed his BS (2019) and MS (2021) in Physics at Old Dominion University.  Corey’s family has set up a memorial scholarship with the Physics Department.  https://altmeyerfuneralandcremation.com/obituaries/cory-jacob-sargent/

Old Dominion’s Counseling Center is available to students, faculty, and staff who are having difficulty. You may call to make an appointment with Counseling Services or to receive immediate counseling via telephone call 757-683-4401 and select option 2.    
  

Sincerely,
