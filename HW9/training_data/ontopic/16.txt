Dear Prashant Tomar,
 

Greetings from the Office of Intercultural Relations (OIR)! We are excited to learn about your interest in joining the MINT program from August 14-17.

 

This email is to confirm that your application has been received. Please verify the information you indicated in the form and get back to us at your earliest convenience!

Arrival Date:  July 26th, 2022; Are you currently in Norfolk, VA? Did you arrive safely?
Need Airport Pick-up?: No
Stay at MINT accommodation: No
My colleague, Moses, from OIR will connect with you shortly to schedule a virtual connection via Zoom so that we can get to know each other and have a conversation before you arrive at ODU.  The MINT program agenda will be sent to you before you arrive at ODU. Until then, please take care and feel free to ask any questions you may have.

As a MINT participant, you will be enrolled in The Global Monarch Mentorship Club (GMC) as a mentee! Through this program, GMC Mentors (current ODU international & domestic students) will assist the University in welcoming you to the Monarch family!  

You may visit our website at https://odu.edu/oir/international-initiatives to learn more about the OIR’s International Initiatives and what we do to support the ODU international student community.

 

Thank you once again. We (Moses, Ali, Aey, & Mary) look forward to seeing you soon!
