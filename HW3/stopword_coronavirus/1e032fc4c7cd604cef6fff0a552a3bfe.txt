‘No causal link’ as five UK men suffer rare blood clot after AstraZeneca jab. Laugh or you’ll cry 



Five men in the UK have suffered an “extremely rare” blood clot problem after having the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine, though no causal link with the jab has been established, the medicines regulator has said.
The men, aged 19 to 59, have experienced a specific type of blood clot in the brain together with low blood platelet count. One of the five has since died.
There are no details yet on whether any of them had underlying health conditions.
The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said it was looking at the reports but stressed the events were “extremely rare” and there was a possibility they could have been caused by Covid itself.
It said the cases represented a less than one-in-a-million chance of suffering this type of clot among those who have been vaccinated, while the risk of dying from Covid aged 40 to 49 is one in 1,000.
Lowered blood platelet counts have been found in around 37% of people suffering from Covid-19.
The regulator has concluded that any link between the jab and clots is unproven and the benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine outweigh any risks.
