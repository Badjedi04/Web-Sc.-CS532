Have you ever wondered how people in high-profile, public service jobs can speak so much bull manure and never realize they are just “slinging s***”? Besides the great bull manure master, Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), the director of the Centers for Disease Control, Rochelle Walensky, is rapidly securing her place as the “great bull manure mistress”. Walensky appeared for an interview with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow to sow more bull manure surrounding the CONvid-1984 and the experimental injections.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky announced on Monday that scientific evidence suggests people vaccinated against COVID-19 almost never carry the virus.
Appearing for an interview with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, Walensky said: “Our data from the CDC today suggests that vaccinated people do not carry the virus, don’t get sick, and that it’s not just in the clinical trials, but it’s also in real-world data.”

How does she know this? Well, it seems the CDC released a study on Monday that “found that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were 90% effective after two doses and were 95% effective in preventing COVID-19.” The study, conducted between December and March, looked at 4,000 front-line workers – some vaccinated and some not – who were tested weekly for the CONvid-19.
That’s truly scientific and concrete proof right there – NOT! First, for what were these front-line workers being tested because the supposed virus that causes supposed CONvid-19 has never been proven to exist? Second, what tests were being used – PCR? Those tests are not diagnostic in nature and the inventor of the test, Kary Mullis, stated they were inadequate for that purpose. Moreover, the test is so flawed the false positive rate might as well be 100%. The test cannot tell the difference between a cold, flu or other coronavirus and is not an indicator of illness since past colds, flu or other coronavirus illness can produce false positive results. Third, this injection is not even a vaccine as defined by Taber’s Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary, 1986. Nevertheless, the results, according to The Blaze, found that three individuals who were “vaccinated” contracted the CONvid-19 while 161 individuals who were not “vaccinated” became infected.


Out of 4,000 study participants, only 164 tested “positive”. This proves nothing. Group participants were slotted as follows: 2,500 that received two injections, 500 that received one injection, and 1,000 that received no injections. That is not truly representative at all.
In fact, KRON 4 out of San Francisco reported:
The researchers counted 205 infections, with 161 of them in the unvaccinated group. Of the remaining 44, the CDC said 33 of them were in people apparently infected with two weeks of their last shot, the point at which they are considered fully vaccinated.
No one died, and only two were hospitalized. Thompson did not say whether the people hospitalized were vaccinated or not.
Here’s the kicker in the study – participants were given nasal swab test kits to use weekly to check “for signs of infection”. Seriously? The test doesn’t “check for signs of infection”, which would be fever, cough, difficulty breathing, diaphoresis (sweating), fatigue, etc. The test checks for anything and everything contained in your nose that a lab will classify as the CONvid-19 depending on the number of cycles run. That test could find mosquito poop in your nose and come up “positive” for the CONvid.
These results still mean zip.
Of course the leader of the study, Mark Thompson, chimed in with his bull manure saying, “This is very reassuring news. We have a vaccine that’s working well.”
Who in government wouldn’t say that when six people working for the NIAID have patents on these injections and stand to make $150K annually from their administration?
Sen. Rand Paul couldn’t resist to weigh-in on Walensky’s statement that “vaccinated individuals do not carry” CONvid-19. You can’t carry something that doesn’t exist. And, no one knows what those injections putting unstable mRNA, some degraded, into the body is producing. In a tweet on Wednesday, Paul wrote, “paging Dr. Fauci: please end the mask theatre now that the cdc admits evidence that vaccinated do not carry the virus.”
Sen. Paul, to what evidence are you referring? There is no evidence of anything. You are supposed to be a doctor. Did you earn your medical degree from a box of Cracker Jacks like Fauci? Earth to Sen. Paul – the virus has not been proven to exist, the injections prevent nothing but do alter the human genome, and masks don’t work period. Readers of the Sons of Liberty Media and most average Americans know this. Why don’t you? Quit encouraging the bull manure!
By now, everyone has heard about the disagreement that Sen. Paul had with Fauci over masks.
During a Senate hearing on the nation’s coronavirus response, Paul questioned Fauci on the science behind his recommendation, asking if any studies had shown mask-wearing is necessary post-vaccination.
“No scientific studies have shown significant numbers of reinfections of patients previously infected or previously vaccinated, what specific studies do you cite to argue that the public should be wearing masks well into 2022?” Paul asked.
“You’re telling everybody to wear a mask whether they’ve had an infection or a vaccine, what I’m saying is they have immunity and everybody agrees they have immunity,” he continued. “What studies do you have that people who have had the vaccine or have had the infection are spreading the infection?”
“If we’re not spreading the infection, isn’t it just theater?” Paul pressed.
“Here we go again with the theater,” Fauci responded. “Let’s get down to facts.”
Fauci argued that different variants of the coronavirus present “a good reason to wear a mask,” citing a Johnson & Johnson study that found some individuals previously infected with “wild” type of coronavirus had no resistance to and were infected by a South African variant of the virus.
“I agree with you that you very likely would have protection from wild type for at least six months if you’re infected but we in our country now have variants that are circulating,” Fauci said.
But Paul pushed back on Fauci’s assertion, demanding that the doctor point to a scientific study that shows there’s significant risk of coronavirus reinfection, hospitalization, or death for people who have been vaccinated.
“It doesn’t exist. There is no evidence that there are significant reinfections after vaccine,” Paul contended.
Fauci said Paul was “not hearing what I’m saying about variants,” but the senator countered that there is no evidence of a significant problem with coronavirus reinfections. Fauci then explained the coronavirus variants aren’t prevalent enough to cause a problem but may become a serious issue later.
“You’re making policy based on conjecture,” Paul accused.
“You’ve been vaccinated and you parade around in two masks for show,” he continued. “You can’t get it again, there’s virtually 0% chance you’re going to get it … you’re defying everything we know about immunity by telling people to wear masks who’ve been vaccinated.”
“Let me just state for the record that masks are not theater, masks are protective,” Fauci began to say before Paul interjected.
“Past-immunity they are theater,” the senator said. “If you already have immunity, you’re wearing a mask to give comfort to others. You’re not wearing a mask because of any science.”
“I totally disagree with you,” Fauci said.
Fauci did not point to a scientific study that shows there is a significant risk of coronavirus reinfection for vaccinated Americans.
Sen. Paul, the next time you want to confront Fauci about masks, the non-existent virus, these injections or non-pharmaceutical interventions, contact Sons of Liberty Media so those of us who have researched for a year can give you some help. Here’s a clue for you “Dr. Rand Paul”, the use of the term doctor is very loose: Wearing masks PERIOD is theater because masks don’t work to prevent illness or prevent transmission. You as a “doctor” should know that. In fact, if you read the warning on the mask box, it tells you that directly. [Shaking my head].
Does anyone else see the generous helping of bull manure these idiots are spewing?
Interestingly enough, the National Institute of Health (NIH) is backing a research study to determine “if there is significant risk of asymptomatic spread of COVID-19 among people who have received the Moderna [injection]”.
If you feel like pounding Fauci’s head against a brick wall, you are not alone. This is a face palm event. Asymptomatic individuals are those individuals WHO ARE NOT SICK and DO NOT spread illness.
“We hope that within the next five or so months we’ll be able to answer the very important question about whether vaccinated people get infected asymptomatically, and if they do, do they transmit the infection to others,” Fauci said during a White House COVID-19 task force briefing on Friday.
Bull manure on top of bull manure on top of bull manure. That’s exactly the analogy we used in college for those who were getting doctorates in certain areas of study – Piled higher and Deeper (PhD).
For all these medical doctorates these people hold, it’s a shame they have to be “nurse-slapped”; but, alas, such is the depth of fraud at all levels. They know the facts and they all look stupid continually repeating bull manure. We all know there is only one reason they keep shamelessly spewing bull manure – it is for total control of the people through medical tyranny.
