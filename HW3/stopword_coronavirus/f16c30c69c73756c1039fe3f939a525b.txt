White House targets conservatives for vaccine death shots in hopes that conservative deaths might keep up with left-wing deaths

(Natural News) It would seem as though most left-wingers are eager to get injected for the Wuhan coronavirus (Covid-19), if they have not done so already. Conservatives, on the other hand, are far more “hesitant,” which is why the Biden regime is scheming up new campaigns aimed at luring Republicans into getting jabbed.
To better balance the number of shot-induced injuries and deaths between the two political parties, China Joe and his cohorts have to figure out a way to convince more conservatives to roll up their sleeves and get needled. One way they are attempting to do this is by enlisting the help of NASCAR and other right-leaning organizations.
According to John Bridgeland, a Republican and veteran of both the George W. Bush and Barack Obama regimes, nearly half of all American conservatives are saying no way to Wuhan flu shots. This is compared to just 14 percent of liberals.

Bridgeland believes that getting more “faith-based” institutions on board, as well as sports leagues and other things conservatives like, many more Republicans will agree to let down their guard and allow the government to permanently alter their genetic code by injecting them with experimental gene therapy syringes.
“We, the country and individuals, don’t need the confusion of politics interjected into what is a public health inquiry,” says Bridgeland about a public service advertisement put out by the Ad Council that features four former presidents, not including President Trump.

Blacks and Hispanics don’t want Covid injections, either – only white liberals do!
Even though Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” program is responsible for unleashing China virus injections on the masses, Trump has reportedly not agreed to appear in any advertising campaigns that promote them. Bush, Obama, and the other usual suspects are pushing them instead.
The Biden regime, meanwhile, recognizes that “hesitant” conservatives, as well as black and Hispanic Americans of all political leanings, will probably never be convinced to get jabbed just because politicians are urging them to do so. The only demographic that obeys the government’s order appears to be white liberals.
This is why Beijing Biden is employing other tactics such as having famous people, pastors, community leaders, and other non-politicians tell their followers to get stabbed in order to ward off Chinese germs.
Another person who almost nobody is listening to anymore is Anthony Fauci. If Fauci says to do it, Americans tend to do the opposite, recognizing that this stooge is about as qualified a doctor as Dr. Seuss.
“The thing that has more impact than anything Trump would say to the MAGA folks is what the local doctor, what the local preachers, what the local people in the community would say,” Hunter’s dad is quoted as stating.
As for NASCAR, those pushing China virus jabs recognize that in order for this angle to work, NASCAR would need to aggressively distance its pro-jab campaign from all things Biden.


A senior Republican aide told the Washington Examiner that the Biden White House is not even bothering with trying to convince conservative members of Congress to push Wuhan flu shots on their constituents. Instead, the focus is on using non-politicians to send that message.
“There needs to be a big push to put the kinds of doctors who are actually seeing patients and administering the vaccine to people in front of this group and not, you know, Dr. Fauci, or people with political baggage,” this aide says.
