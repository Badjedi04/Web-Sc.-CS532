Mark Rutte is not Prime Minister anymore as his Cabinet has resigned over one minister fired and one minister stepped down. In NL it means the Cabinet and Mark Rutte has resigned. No new Cabinet formed since June. So according to our State laws he has to call for new elections something he refused for months and now we have here a Junta Rutte in NL. Unelected, coup d’Etat by Mark Rutte. First Nazi fascist dictator since 1945.
