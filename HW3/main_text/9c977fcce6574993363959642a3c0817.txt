The only thing the un”vaccinated” are a threat to right now is the New World Order agenda’s rollout. But Dr. Anthony Fauci insists that those who have continued to refuse to take the experimental gene therapy shots are a problem.
Even though people are figuring out this scam and beginning to understand it’s been a hoax to inject the worldwide population from the beginning, Fauci continues to double down.
“We are on a downslope right now, if you look at the parameters of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths,” Fauci said, according to a report by Yahoo News.  “They continue to come down. But we are not at a comfortable place, yet. We still have about 65,000 to 70,000 new cases per day. We have to go much lower than that. As we said so often, it really depends on our ability to vaccinate a considerably larger number of people because right now, about 64 million people in this country are eligible to be vaccinated who have not yet gotten vaccinated.”

“If you’re going to take the chance of saying we are going to get to community immunity by just having people get infected so that you get infected people, plus vaccinated people, and you have protection, that’s a very high price to pay,” Fauci said. “We don’t want any more than the 740,000 people or so who have already died from this outbreak,” he added using the fake and inaccurate death toll numbers being lied about to gin up the fear.
Oddly enough, Fauci even admits that the vaccinated are still spreading the scamdemic around.  That means the juice isn’t doing what they told the public it would do.


“People fully vaccinated are worried about being around people unvaccinated. Aren’t both people able to carry and spread the virus? Why should vaccinated people be more worried, more afraid of people who don’t have the vaccine,” asked Raj. “I don’t think one can say we are more or less afraid of one particular individual,” Fauci said. “But I think under the circumstances we know particularly in an indoor setting, that both unvaccinated and vaccinated people can spread the infection. That’s one of the reasons why the CDC makes a recommendation that when you are in an indoor congregate setting when you don’t know the status of the individuals involved that we still now, recommend the wearing of masks.”
So there you have it. No one is safe from the common cold they renamed COVID-19 whether you are vaccinated or not. So put on the ritualistic shame muzzle, and just obey and comply with your rulers. Suspend all critical thinking and do what you’re told. Then they’ll end the pandemic hoax.
