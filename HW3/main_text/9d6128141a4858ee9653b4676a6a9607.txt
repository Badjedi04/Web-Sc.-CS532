We told you there was something fishy about the unconstitutional claims of the Food and Drug Administration’s “full approval” of Pfizer’s COVID shots, and now even the Pfizer site states that their BNT162B2 shot is “not approved or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).”

Here’s the language from Pfizer’s own site.
PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE
(ALSO KNOWN AS BNT162B2)
This product information is intended only for residents of the United States.
This product is exclusively distributed within the U.S. under an Emergency Use Authorization from FDA.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. The emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564(b)(1) of the FD&C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. Please see EUA Fact Sheet at www.cvdvaccine.com.
Here’s how the page on the Pfizer-Biontech COVID-19 Vaccine (Also Known as BNT162B2) appears as of October 26, 2021.



When one clicks on the cvdvaccine.com link, one can select “I am NOT a Healthcare Professional and will be taken to this page, comirnaty.com.

Notice what we read there.

Notice the bait and switch taking place.
First, Pfizer declares that the FDA AUTHORIZED THE EMERGENCY USE of their COVID-19 “vaccine.”
Second, Pfizer states that on August 23, 2021, their COMIRNATY shot received FDA APPROVAL.
These are two DIFFERENT shots. How do I know this? Read the fine print after the asterik above.
“*The licensed COMIRNATY vaccine has the same formulation as the authorized vaccine Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and the products can be used interchangeably to provide the vaccination series without presenting any safety or effectiveness concerns. The products are legally distinct, with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.”
So, they claim is that they can be interchangeable, but only one is authorized while the other remains in EUA status. Get it? Yeah, it appears the FDA and Pfizer are deceiving the people about what is really going on with this shot.
Just to be clear, the labeling by Pfizer, which was updated on October 2021 declares the following:
You are being offered either COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) or the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2.
This Vaccine Information Fact Sheet for Recipients and Caregivers comprises the Fact Sheet for the authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine and also includes information about the FDA-licensed vaccine, COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA).
The FDA-approved COMIRNATY (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) and the FDA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine under Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably to provide doses for COVID-19 primary vaccination or a booster dose.

See? They are telling you there are two shots and claim they can be used interchangeably, but they also tell you there are both “legally distinct, with certain differences.”
Which one are people getting in the US? The FDA approved one or the FDA EUA one?
According to attorney Robert Barnes, COMIRNATY was not available to the US market, but the EUA Pfizer BNT162B2 shot is. Dr. David Martin seems to agree.

This is one of the most devilish things I’ve come across in this entire mess, and I believe the people have a right to know about this shell game Pfizer and the FDA are playing with people’s lives. These shots have been proven time and again to neither be safe nor effective, just like medical professionals around the world warned about early on.

This is probably the reason why Pfizer blows away the competition in the US with the number of deaths and adverse reactions to their shot several times more than their competitors.
