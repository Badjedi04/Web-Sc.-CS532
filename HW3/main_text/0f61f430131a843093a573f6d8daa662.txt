Friends, it’s time to expand your memory and get out of the “36 hour” cycle – only remembering news that happened within the last 36 hours. Why? In case you missed it, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has endorsed former University of Georgia Football player Herschel Walker in Walker’s challenge to Raphael Warnock (D-GA) in the race for US Senator in Georgia. McConnell stated, “I am happy to endorse Herschel Walker for U.S. Senate in Georgia. Herschel is the only one who can unite the party, defeat Senator [Raphael] Warnock, and help us take back the Senate. I look forward to working with Herschel in Washington to get the job done.”
Does anyone remember when this same Republican tool was begging for votes to elect Republicans to “stop Obama” and Obamacare? If you do, do you remember what happened? Everything Obama wanted got a “green light”. Obamacare was not repealed; in fact, Republicans were working overtime to pass their socialist health care insurance legislation, which failed. Do you remember what happened when Donald Trump occupied the White House with a Republican majority House and Senate? Nada, Zilch, nothing. Obamacare remains in place except for the individual mandate. The GOP worked overtime to undermine Trump and the Constitution – not that Trump needed any help. Trump did fine on his own violating the Constitution, just as his predecessors. But, when McConnell faced a proven fraudulent 2020 election based on States violating the Constitution, McConnell refused to hold to the Constitution. See Publius Huldah’s excellent piece on election of presidents.
Now, McConnell is endorsing Herschel Walker. In return, Walker praised McConnell for “his commitment to bringing the party together toward the collective goal of defeating Senator Warnock. The Democrats have already said they will spend whatever it takes to keep Georgia blue. The stakes have never been higher — if we all work together, we will win next November, and take back the Senate.”

Warnock is up for reelection since Warnock is a freshman Senator. See Article I, Section 3 of the Constitution for the united States of America.
According to Breitbart.com:


Walker’s campaign kicked off in August with the support of former President Donald Trump, who encouraged Walker to run in the months leading up to his official announcement.
McConnell’s endorsement comes just days after Senate Minority Whip John Thune (R-SD) endorsed Walker, marking Walker’s first endorsement from the GOP’s Senate leadership team. With both McConnell and Thune’s blessings, Walker’s support from the Republican Party establishment is cemented.
Republican leaders were hesitant to endorse Walker, worrying about the football star’s lack of political experience and reports alleging domestic abuse and financial mismanagement.
Pot meet kettle. Republican servants were hesitant to endorse Herschel Walker because of “lack of political experience and reports alleging domestic abuse and financial mismanagement”; yet, these servants have repeatedly violated the Constitution, engaged in activities that have produced net worth in the millions on a $174,000 per year salary, refused to bring justice upon the heads of criminals like Anthony Fauci, and failed to uphold the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments regarding those who protested on January 6th, 2021, and unlawful injection mandates, potential quarantine and “re-education” regarding those who support freedom to choose medical treatments as well as the unlawful attack on Americans by the Biden regime through unlawful IRS spying on banking transactions. And, this is only scratching the surface of these lawless individuals.
Interestingly, Republican “leadership” only endorsed Walker after he chose to break from Trump over voter fraud messaging. Question, if Walker is a “man for the people”, would it matter whether Republicans endorsed him? If Walker were a man who supports the law, why would he align himself with an unconstitutional party? Moreover, Walker raised $3.7 million for his campaign despite his late start in August, with third quarter fundraising ending in September. It’s obvious the GOP doesn’t want to “miss out” on those funds.
Walker also distanced himself from Trump’s message for “Republicans” to sit out voting in the mid-term elections until voter fraud is addressed. Walker said everyone has to get out to vote because we can’t look at the past. Well, those who do not learn from history are destined to repeat it. In this instance, this statement is referring to mistakes. In other words, if voting/election fraud is allowed to stand, which it is from both unconstitutional parties, voting/election fraud will become the norm so voting will not matter. As Joseph Stalin is credited with saying, “Let everyone vote. It doesn’t matter who votes; it matters who counts the votes.”
Walker is relying on his name recognition to get him elected to the Senate to replace the communist, anti-biblical, fake reverend Raphael Warnock. Yes, he is a fake reverend because he preaches and supports that which the Bible condemns. But, is Walker any better?
Before his campaign gets in full swing, Walker has exposed himself as an appeaser – he backed away from proven voter/election fraud to gain endorsement from an unconstitutional party. Other Republicans endorsing Walker include Senators Josh Hawley (R-MO), Steve Daines (R-MT), Roger Marshall (R-KS), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and John Thune (R-SD). Not that Trump was a good wagon to which one should hitch their horses, but Walker broke with Trump’s messaging on voter/election fraud, which Trump is correct on the issue of election integrity. And, it doesn’t matter how many so-called Republicans or non-party aligned individuals turned out to vote, Americans witnessed rampant fraud on the part of county election officials in multiple States, which is now proven, to stuff the votes in favor of a man who can’t rub two brain cells together to get a spark and a jezebel who rode the “coattails” of Willie Brown to get ahead then couldn’t gain enough support to continue a presidential campaign of her own. Does any American have any confidence in the voting process at this point? Don’t forget the numerous State election officials who violated the Constitution by changing voting parameters set forth lawfully by Congress.
McConnell claims Walker is the only one who can “unite the party” and the only one who can defeat Raphael Warnock. Seriously? The man who stood on the Senate floor claiming to have zero ability to fight election fraud – his exact words were “we don’t have authority to overturn and election” – by holding States and their respective counties to the Constitution regarding voting now spreads more propaganda regarding an individual whose only known for playing football for the University of Georgia, winning a Heisman trophy, playing professional football for several teams, and being an athlete.
In February of 2021, CNN revealed that Walker suffers from dissociative identity disorder or what was previously called multiple personality disorder.
Asked how many different personality facets, or alters, he has, Walker replied: “To be honest, I have no idea.” But in the book, Walker talks about a dozen. [Emphasis Mine.] They’re described by their roles or function: the Hero, the Coach, the Enforcer, the Consoler, the Daredevil, the Warrior, to name a few.
Some of these alters did a lot of good, he said. But others led to some extreme and violent behavior, most of which Walker said he doesn’t remember. As a result, the disorder, or DID, led to the breakup of his marriage. “I lost the person that was like everything to me,” he said. “I lost my wife and that’s totally, totally devastating to me.”
Walker said a competitive alter caused him to be a danger to himself, playing Russian roulette more than once. In the book he describes another incident, the very late delivery of a car, that made him so angry he had thoughts of killing someone. It was the moment he realized had to seek help, he said, which ultimately led to his diagnosis.
Nobody witnessed his alters surfacing more than Cindy Grossman, now remarried, but who was Mrs. Herschel Walker for 19 years.
For 16 years of her marriage, Grossman said, she didn’t know anything was wrong. That’s because Walker’s various alters were somehow kept in check. He believes during that time, his alters did a lot of good. They helped him train hard to become an outstanding athlete and student, smashing high school football records, graduating at the top of his class and evolving into one of the greatest college football players ever.
When football was out of Walker’s life, his alters were no longer focusing on a common goal. That’s when things started to go wrong. Dr. Jerry Mungadze, Walker’s therapist, said he’s seen at least three of Walker’s alters and believes that after retiring from football, Walker “had to find another way of coping and couldn’t.” That search led to the chaos in Walker’s life. 
Grossman said that after Walker learned he had DID, things got a lot worse. She remembers the emotional extremes: “Very violent alters and very sweet alters.” When the bad alters surfaced, she said, Walker sounded different and his eyes would get “evil — I remember just getting chill bumps when he looked at me.”
She said that Walker held a gun to her head a handful of times. He also threatened her with knives. She remembers one situation where at least two alters were involved: She was in bed and couldn’t see very well because she didn’t have her contact lenses in. Suddenly, she said, Walker threatened her with a straight razor. “He had it to my throat and kept saying he was going to kill me… think he choked me. I think I passed out.
“When I came to, there was someone else there [saying] ‘Cindy, Cindy, Cindy. Wake up, wake up!’ “
Walker said he doesn’t remember the assault, but he also doesn’t deny it. “One of the symptoms of DID is blackouts,” he said. “I do not remember certain events. Cindy and Dr. Jerry Mungadze have relayed confrontations which have been violent or aggressive, but I have no memory of any of it. I’m troubled by my actions and will always deeply regret any pain I’ve caused Cindy. Cindy has been a tremendous help in aiding my therapy and the integration of my personalities. That’s why I wrote the book — to assist others.” 
Doesn’t sound as though this is “alleged”, but fact due to his diagnosed personality disorder.
Which Herschel Walker would Georgians be electing? Which Herschel Walker would be present in the Senate? Shouldn’t Georgians be confident anyone seeking election to office be mentally fit? Absolutely. But, Georgians seem to be tolerating an individual with dementia occupying the White House and criminal election officials in all counties that refused to follow the law.
But, Mitch McConnell is endorsing Walker, as well as six other RINOs in the Senate.
My grandmother always said, “Birds of a feather flock together” and “you are known by the company you keep”. Walker is hitching his wagon to the likes of McConnell, Graham, Thune and others who magnify the crimes of criminal politicians yet never brings any to justice. In fact, McConnell seems to be “justice averse”. What does this say about Herschel Walker? You’ll have to answer that for yourself.
