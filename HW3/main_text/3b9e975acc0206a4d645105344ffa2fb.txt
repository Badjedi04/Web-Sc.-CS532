Millions of Americans voted against President Trump because they disliked his demeanor, and his tweets, and his hair. Now America is paying the price. It’s no wonder why China, North Korea, and Iran are emboldened. The Biden Administration has turned America into a laughing stock in eight short months. Pray for America and the free world.

SLEEPY JOE: Biden Appears to Fall Asleep During Opening Remarks at UN Climate Summit
By Hannity Staff, November 1, 2021
President Biden appeared to doze-off Monday during the opening remarks of the UN’s COP26 Summit on Climate Change in Glasgow, Scotland.
 
“Biden appears to fall asleep during COP26 opening speeches,” posted a reporter with the Washington Post on Twitter.

The footage comes days after Biden met with French President Macron; telling the European leader the US arms sale to Australia was “clumsy.”
“Is your relationship repaired?” asked one reporter in Rome
“The answer is, I think we, uh, what happened, was uh, to use an English phrase… uh… clumsy,” said the American President.
Climate Czar John Kerry caused a stir on social media earlier this month after telling a French TV network that Joe Biden had “literally had not been aware” of the United States’ Nuclear submarine deal with Australia.
“President Biden asked me about it. And I told him about it. He asked me what the situation was. He had not been aware of that. He had literally not been aware of what had transpired,” said Kerry. “The President is very committed to strengthening the relationship.”
