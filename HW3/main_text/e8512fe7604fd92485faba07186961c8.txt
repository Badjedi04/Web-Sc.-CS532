‘The transition from using “Covid” to using Climate Change as the justification for implementing the Fourth Industrial Revolution and the “digital transformation” of the economy and society is well underway’ – Whitney Webb 


Whitney Webb is a writer and researcher for Unlimited Hangout and The Last American Vagabond.  She mostly covers intelligence, technology, surveillance and civil liberties.  Webb made the comment regarding Covid and Climate Change on a tweet in a thread by Jesse Matchey.  Below is the first part of Matchey’s twitter thread consisting of a series of short video clips.
Matchey’s thread was in response to a tweet from another user, @laninaleone, who’s twitter “account no longer exists.”
Matchey begins his thread: “Even for the non-religious people out there, you can’t deny the merger of different faiths and the oddity of the pope teaming up with one of Epstein’s main co-conspirators (Lynn Rothschild).  Or Klaus Schwab’s praise of Hélder Câmara.”  The thread then continues with a series of videos without comment.
The following are the first 12 video clips from his thread. We have added bits of information to give some context where we felt it would be useful or interesting.
Schwab is Founder and Executive Chairman of the World Economic Forum, as well as the founder of the Global Shapers Community and The Forum of Young Global Leaders.
Câmara is a Brazilian Catholic archbishop who was a Council Father at the Second Vatican Council and was known colloquially as “The Red Bishop” due to his condemnation of the anti-communist stance of the U.S. and his praise of Mao Tse-Tung during the Cultural Revolution, which claimed millions of lives.
