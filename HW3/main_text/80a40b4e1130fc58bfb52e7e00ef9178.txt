The covid bio-terrorism trail leads back to CCP collaborators, Anthony Fauci and Peter Daszak

(Natural News) When controversial, gain-of-function virus research was banned in the United States in October of 2014, top scientists in the government and in the private sector had to immediately halt twenty-one projects related to virus manipulation and vaccine development for influenza viruses and coronaviruses like SARS and MERS. Controversial projects at Harvard, Emory and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill were suspended. At the time, scientists were genetically modifying respiratory viruses to develop lucrative new vaccines for the pharmaceutical industry and the global health market.
Instead of following ethics and law, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID), plunged forward with controversial gain-of-function coronavirus research. Instead of conducting research in the United States, Dr. Fauci tapped his friend Peter Daszak of the Eco Health Alliance. Daszak is the famed zoologist who first discovered the bat origin of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), ten years prior. Daszak enjoyed connections with the Wuhan Institute of Virology in communist China and was adamant about continuing this unethical research offshore.
Dr. Fauci went on to approve $7.4 million in taxpayer funds to complete the studies through Eco Health Alliance. After taking government money from Fauci in 2016, Peter Daszak promoted the self-aggrandizing Dr. Fauci at events sponsored by Eco Health Alliance. The two bio-terrorists enjoy a longstanding relationship to this day.


Fauci directly involved in gain-of-function coronavirus research in China

Zhengli collected the bat samples and reported back to Fauci. Chinese virologists analyzed and sequenced the genetic information of the coronaviruses obtained from bats and were told to build genetically engineered viruses, or chimeras, that could readily infect human cells. To continue receiving money, the head of the Wuhan lab, Dr. Shi Zhengli, reported back to Fauci on the progress they were making on coronaviruses.



To come up with highly infectious coronaviruses, the Chinese researchers used the CRISPR gene editing tool to alter mice lung cells. The scientists equipped the mice with the ACE2 receptor from human lung cells – the same receptor that SARS-CoV-2 exploits in human immune systems. The Chinese researchers came clean about their work in June 2020, when they published a new model for studying SARS-CoV-2, one that uses enhanced gain-of-function properties that Fauci supported.
Ten years ago, Dr. Fauci used the NIAID to fund the first gain-of-function coronavirus study. The research that Fauci funded in the Netherlands made genetic changes to coronaviruses so they could be more readily transferred through the air. After demonstrating airborne transmission of the virus on ferret populations, the researchers sought to replicate the contagion in human cells. Fauci praised this research in an op-ed in the Washington Post, calling it “a risk worth taking.” He wrote, “Important information and insight can come from generating a potentially dangerous virus in the laboratory…”

Fauci and Daszak have engaged in bio-terrorism for years and continue to get away with it
Fauci concealed ongoing gain-of-function coronavirus research through New York’s Eco Health Alliance. Dr. Fauci funded a project there to learn about the risk of new coronaviruses, and how they could emerge from wild animals to rapidly infect humans. Isn’t it suspicious that Fauci quickly claimed that covid-19 was of natural origins, when he was the biggest supporter and funder of gain-of-function research for years?
The experimental vaccines that are pouring out of pharmaceutical companies at warp speed are designed to capitalize on the bio-terrorism, for this was the intention of gain-of-function virus research to begin with. Fauci has terrorized populations into compliance with these experimental vaccines, using coercion and deceit to submit people’s minds and bodies to the bio-terrorism and the corresponding vaccine “solutions.”
In 2016, the National Science Advisory Board for Bio-security (NSABB) ruled that government-funded gain-of-function experiments do not pose a significant threat to public health most of the time. By December 19, 2017, the NIH lifted the ban on gain-of-function research, normalizing research that enhances the attachment properties of respiratory viruses. In August 2000, the NIH reinstated a $7.5 million grant to Eco Health Alliance, going against the advice of Dr. Michael Lauer, NIH’s Deputy Director for Extramural Research. Dr. Lauer considered a suspension of federal funds for coronavirus gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, but is being ignored by Fauci and Daszak, as they continue on with their experiments on human biology.
A vicious cycle of fear and control will only continue as bio-terrorists continue to exploit humans and abuse populations with their “science.”
