The Fear Pandemic and the Crisis of Capitalism 

Editor 


Colin Todhunter

In October 2019, in a speech at an International Monetary Fund conference, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King warned that the world was sleepwalking towards a fresh economic and financial crisis that would have devastating consequences for what he called the “democratic market system”.
According to King, the global economy was stuck in a low growth trap and recovery from the crisis of 2008 was weaker than that after the Great Depression. He concluded that it was time for the Federal Reserve and other central banks to begin talks behind closed doors with politicians.
In the repurchase agreement (repo) market, interest rates soared on 16 September. The Federal Reserve stepped in by intervening to the tune of $75 billion per day over four days, a sum not seen since the 2008 crisis.
At that time, according to Fabio Vighi, professor of critical theory at Cardiff University, the Fed began an emergency monetary programme that saw hundreds of billions of dollars per week pumped into Wall Street.
Over the last 18 months or so, under the guise of a ‘pandemic’, we have seen economies closed down, small businesses being crushed, workers being made unemployed and people’s rights being destroyed. Lockdowns and restrictions have facilitated this process. 
The purpose of these so-called ‘public health measures’ has little to do with public health and much to do with managing a crisis of capitalism and ultimately the restructuring of the economy.
Neoliberalism has squeezed workers income and benefits, offshored key sectors of economies and has used every tool at its disposal to maintain demand and create financial Ponzi schemes in which the rich can still invest and profit from. 
The bailouts to the banking sector following the 2008 crash provided only temporary respite. The crash returned with a much bigger bang pre-Covid along with multi-billion-dollar bailouts.
The dystopian ‘great reset’ that we are currently witnessing is a response to this crisis. This reset envisages a transformation of capitalism.
Fabio Vighi sheds light on the role of the ‘pandemic’ in all of this:
…some may have started wondering why the usually unscrupulous ruling elites decided to freeze the global profit-making machine in the face of a pathogen that targets almost exclusively the unproductive (over 80s).”
Vighi describes how, in pre-Covid times, the world economy was on the verge of another colossal meltdown and chronicles how the Swiss Bank of International Settlements, BlackRock (the world’s most powerful investment fund), G7 central bankers and others worked to avert a massive impending financial meltdown.
The world economy was suffocating under an unsustainable mountain of debt. Many companies could not generate enough profit to cover interest payments on their own debts and were staying afloat only by taking on new loans. Falling turnover, squeezed margins, limited cashflows and highly leveraged balance sheets were rising everywhere.
Lockdowns and the global suspension of economic transactions were intended to allow the Fed to flood the ailing financial markets (under the guise of COVID) with freshly printed money while shutting down the real economy to avoid hyperinflation.
Vighi says:
…the stock market did not collapse (in March 2020) because lockdowns had to be imposed; rather, lockdowns had to be imposed because financial markets were collapsing. With lockdowns came the suspension of business transactions, which drained the demand for credit and stopped the contagion. In other words, restructuring the financial architecture through extraordinary monetary policy was contingent on the economy’s engine being turned off.”
It all amounted to a multi-trillion bailout for Wall Street under the guise of COVID ‘relief’ followed by an ongoing plan to fundamentally restructure capitalism that involves smaller enterprises being driven to bankruptcy or bought up by monopolies and global chains, thereby ensuring continued viable profits for these predatory corporations, and the eradication of millions of jobs resulting from lockdowns and accelerated automation.
Author and journalist Matt Taibbi noted in 2020:
It retains all the cruelties of the free market for those who live and work in the real world, but turns the paper economy into a state protectorate, surrounded by a kind of Trumpian Money Wall that is designed to keep the investor class safe from fear of loss. This financial economy is a fantasy casino, where the winnings are real but free chips cover the losses. For a rarefied segment of society, failure is being written out of the capitalist bargain.”
The World Economic Forum says that by 2030 the public will ‘rent’ everything they require. This means undermining the right of ownership (or possibly seizing personal assets) and restricting consumer choice underpinned by the rhetoric of reducing public debt or ‘sustainable consumption’, which will be used to legitimise impending austerity as a result of the economic meltdown. Ordinary people will foot the bill for the ‘COVID relief’ packages.
If the financial bailouts do not go according to plan, we could see further lockdowns imposed, perhaps justified under the pretext of ‘the virus’ but also ‘climate emergency’.
It is not only Big Finance that has been saved. A previously ailing pharmaceuticals industry has also received a massive bailout (public funds to develop and purchase the vaccines) and lifeline thanks to the money-making COVID jabs.
The lockdowns and restrictions we have seen since March 2020 have helped boost the bottom line of global chains and the e-commerce giants as well and have cemented their dominance. At the same time, fundamental rights have been eradicated under COVID government measures.
Capitalism and labour
Essential to this ‘new normal’ is the compulsion to remove individual liberties and personal freedoms. A significant part of the working class has long been deemed ‘surplus to requirements’ – such people were sacrificed on the altar of neo-liberalism. They lost their jobs due to automation and offshoring. 
Since then, this section of the population has had to rely on meagre state welfare and run-down public services or, if ‘lucky’, insecure low-paid service sector jobs.
What we saw following the 2008 crash was ordinary people being pushed further to the edge. After a decade of ‘austerity’ in the UK – a neoliberal assault on the living conditions of ordinary people carried out under the guise of reining in public debt following the bank bail outs – a leading UN poverty expert compared Conservative welfare policies to the creation of 19th-century workhouses and warned that, unless austerity is ended, the UK’s poorest people face lives that are “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short”.
Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, accused ministers of being in a state of denial about the impact of policies. He accused them of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population”.
In another 2019 report, the Institute for Public Policy Research think tank laid the blame for more than 130,000 deaths in the UK since 2012 at the door of government policies. It claimed that these deaths could have been prevented if improvements in public health policy had not stalled as a direct result of austerity cuts.
Over the past 10 years in the UK, according to the Trussell Group, there has been rising food poverty and increasing reliance on food banks.
And in a damning report on poverty in the UK by Professor David Gordon of the University of Bristol, it was found that almost 18 million cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 12 million are too poor to engage in common social activities, one in three cannot afford to heat their homes adequately in winter and four million children and adults are not properly fed (Britain’s population is estimated at around 66 million).
Moreover, a 2015 report by the New Policy Institute noted that the total number of people in poverty in the UK had increased by 800,000, from 13.2 to 14.0 million in just two to three years.
Meanwhile, The Equality Trust in 2018 reported that the ‘austerity’ years were anything but austere for the richest 1,000 people in the UK. They had increased their wealth by £66 billion in one year alone (2017-2018), by £274 billion in five years (2013-2018) and had increased their total wealth to £724 billion – significantly more than the poorest 40% of households combined (£567 billion).
Just some of the cruelties of the ‘free market’ for those who live and work in the real world. And all of this hardship prior to lockdowns that have subsequently devastated lives, livelihoods and health, with cancer diagnoses and treatments and other conditions having been neglected due to the shutdown of health services.
During the current economic crisis, what we are seeing is many millions around the world being robbed of their livelihoods. With AI and advanced automation of production, distribution and service provision on the immediate horizon, a mass labour force will no longer be required.
It raises fundamental questions about the need for and the future of mass education, welfare and healthcare provision and systems that have traditionally served to reproduce and maintain labour that capitalist economic activity has required.
As the economy is restructured, labour’s relationship to capital is being transformed. If work is a condition of the existence of the labouring classes, then, in the eyes of capitalists, why maintain a pool of (surplus) labour that is no longer needed?
A concentration of wealth power and ownership is taking place as a result of COVID-related policies: according to research by Oxfam, the world’s billionaires gained $3.9 trillion while working people lost $3.7 trillion in 2020. 
At the same time, as large sections of the population head into a state of permanent unemployment, the rulers are weary of mass dissent and resistance. We are witnessing an emerging biosecurity surveillance state designed to curtail liberties ranging from freedom of movement and assembly to political protest and free speech.
The global implications are immense too. Barely a month into the COVID agenda, the IMF and World Bank were already facing a deluge of aid requests from developing countries that were asking for bailouts and loans. 
Ideal cover for rebooting the global economy via a massive debt crisis and the subsequent privatisation of national assets.
In 2020, World Bank Group President David Malpass stated that poorer countries will be ‘helped’ to get back on their feet after the various lockdowns but such ‘help’ would be on condition that neoliberal reforms become further embedded. 
In other words, the de facto privatisation of states (affecting all nations, rich and poor alike), the (complete) erosion of national sovereignty and dollar-denominated debt leading to a further strengthening of US leverage and power.
In a system of top-down surveillance capitalism with an increasing section of the population deemed ‘unproductive’ and ‘useless eaters’, notions of individualism, liberal democracy and the ideology of free choice and consumerism are regarded by the elite as ‘unnecessary luxuries’ along with political and civil rights and freedoms.
We need only look at the ongoing tyranny in Australia to see where other countries could be heading. How quickly Australia was transformed from a ‘liberal democracy’ to a brutal totalitarian police state of endless lockdowns where gathering and protests are not to be tolerated.
Being beaten and thrown to the ground and fired at with rubber bullets in the name of protecting health makes as much sense as devastating entire societies through socially and economically destructive lockdowns to ‘save lives’.
It makes as much sense as mask-wearing and social-distancing mandates unsupported by science, misused and flawed PCR tests, perfectly healthy people being labelled as ‘cases’, deliberately inflated COVID death figures, pushing dangerous experimental vaccines in the name of health, ramping up fear, relying on Neil Ferguson’s bogus modelling, censoring debate about any of this and the WHO declaring a worldwide ‘pandemic’ based on a very low number of global ‘cases’ back in early 2020 (44,279 ‘cases’ and 1,440 supposed COVID deaths outside China out of a population of 6.4 billion).
There is little if any logic to this. But of course, If we view what is happening in terms of a crisis of capitalism, it might begin to make a lot more sense.
The austerity measures that followed the 2008 crash were bad enough for ordinary people who were still reeling from the impacts when the first lockdown was imposed.
The authorities are aware that deeper, harsher impacts as well as much more wide-ranging changes will be experienced this time around and seem adamant that the masses must become more tightly controlled and conditioned to their coming servitude.

There is a letter to the NSW health minister by a solicitor in Sydney which may be of interest. They would also represent anyone being forced by their employer to take the shot.
https://aflsolicitors.com.au/files/Letter-to-NSW-health-Minitser.pdf
I also note that in Victoria Dan Andrews’ very long list of “authorised workers” who must take the shot or else lose their jobs – basically anyone with a job – makes no mention of doctors. – Why is that?
Ditto for New South Wales where various industries are now being given the mandate from government to force their employees to take the shot … but expressly not GP. Why???
I would think that doctors should have been the first to have been coerced into taking this pharmaceutical medication given their contact with the “vulnerable”.

I’d say they outlive us by 20 years, the average age at death is now 80+ so The Queen Mother (God bless her, as we are obliged to say,) who was, I believe, the oldest Royal to date made 102. Queenie is at the time of writing 95 and Phil the Greek was 99. But 20 years is still a big margin.
We The People may be catching up though. Currently Prince Charles is one of my favourite celebs, simply because every time I see him on TV I can think, “That old codger was born in 1948 like me, a couple of months later, but I look 20 years younger. Result.

O/T but see how they run. 
Governments were quick to evoke the Moon landings to support the vaccines, with slogans like Warp Speed and Moonshot. Throughout the pandemic the Department of Defense has gotten in on the act, the DOD bizarrely choosing the moment to “hang out” revelations about UFOs.
WTF?
It’s them saying it, not me. Instead of debunking this or that, or arguing about which version you believe, ask why they’re doing this at all.
Of course you’d want to find refuge in the movies of the 1960s or earlier. What sane person wouldn’t?

Appreciate all your work with your blog M. For a while your essays weren’t appearing on my email, and I wondered if you were taking a break, and then discovered this week that for some odd reason they’ve been going into the promotions folder instead of appearing on my usual email wall.
I have a few to catch up on! Good luck to you in your country in the Caucasus.
A lot of us are now being ground down by Event Covid and the machinations of those really pulling the strings. The evil they are inflicting via their foot soldiers and puppets is breath taking.

Pacific Islanders, at the time that James Cook explored the Southern Seas, had all sorts of strange beliefs, that were summarized as tabu (where the word comes from)
One of the things some Pacific Islanders believed in, was that reproduction of mankind was based on the wind or climate or something, anything EXCEPT, sexual intercourse. That was tabu. And they REALLY believed that reproduction could not be explained by sexual intercourse.
Now these Islanders are idiots right, which idiocy is probably best explained by their idiotic culture, that missed all sorts of high European cultural background. And that is how it was explained at that time.
Fast forward to today, where our national statistics department has published that in September, there was excess mortality in NL, again…
https://www.cbs.nl/nl-nl/nieuws/2021/40/in-september-opnieuw-oversterfte
When did excess mortality start? Well, if you look at the graphs in the article, the answer is: around March, when the vaccination of society was quickly ramping up.
Scientists are baffled, and have no clue how this problem can be explained. Maybe it was the wind or climate or something, anything EXCEPT, the vax. Because associating vaccination with excess mortality is tabu.
Which makes perfect sense, as the Pacific Islanders were idiots because they missed all sorts of high European cultural background. Scientists however….

Great post, Willem. Our culture and authorities can only operate using massive cognitive dissonance and willful temporal-historical ignorance.
When I was small I lived in Nigeria and Brazil. My senses were overwhelmed. All of them. In fact, that was the biggest difference upon returning to northern Europe — people didn’t seem to use their senses… to feel.
So. In Brazil you have all kinds of Candomblé which overlaps African and Catholic ritual. You would go to the sea and make little boats and float them out to the “goddess” of the sea. Another time you would make paper hot-air balloons (very popular with tourists but originally for the feast of St John).
Underneath this was a sensibility to the wind, the sea and nature.
In came the Europeans and smashed the African masks.. and 100 years later sent the death squads into Latin America but I will keep away from geopolitics for now.
Nowadays I have to listen to ignorant Gretas lecturing me about the sea, fucking halfwits like Gates telling me about the climate, Rockefeller minions pissing their pants about the population.
What makes the greatest mockery is your inbred, dumbwit Rockefellers only learned about the environment and foreign countries and the Earth when their lazy, good-for-nothing butts landed in some country and they thought they were the first person to see the sunset.
White saviour complex. Nothing more, nothing less.
I could go on. I sat on the beach in Rio with NAZIs in the 1960s… fricking employees of the Rockefellers… and the next generation of School of The Americas…
One day I pray the games they play will rebound on them.
I live in straightened circumstances now, different circles, but I can assure you, If I ever see one of their sorry asses I will not be praying.

Operation Covid has been astonishingly successful. The thought vibrations have been sent and received. I just overheard a conversation. So-and-so thinks he had covid. Someone else did too. Why? Because they were a bit out of breath, because they felt tired etc.
And now the news blasts on about the flu vaccine. And we are about to transition from one “deadly and novel virus” to a general fear of every illness imaginable. (And imagination plays a central role in all this.) The shift from millenia of natural immunity to a shrunken hypochondriac citizenry has been effected!

Well this is how it works. In an atomised society, the media appears as the “glue that holds us together”. So any shit they shovel out appears as the permitted pathway to community. When the covid show started, the media was effectively saying to those attention seekers: Here is your new ticket to fame! Just complain loudly about the following symptoms (produces pamphlet) and you will be assured of the centre stage and tons of adoring fans. Or alternatively, talk in a cracked tone about personal bereavements to covid etc. But let’s face it: We don’t have to tell you drama queens what to do!

My late mother was a lifelong socialist who as a young adult in the 1930s was involved in a lot of what we’d call Anitfa activity these days. I recall her telling us back in the late 60s that the post-WW2 social advances were going to be clawed back. Social change in developed countries was only grudgingly permitted, it was the minimum granted and then only on the surplus from Imperial plunder. People gradually wanted more with real change starting after WW1 when the sacrifices made by ordinary people because of an internecine dispute among European (and British) royalty led to an upswing in demands for reform – or else. The ruling classes pushed back, of course, and their friendliness with Fascism in the 1930s led to it growing into a serious menace that required even more sacrifice by ordinary people. So after WW2 there was not just a popular mood for improvement of people’s lives but active competition in the form of the USSR. The modern consumer society is born out of this and generations have now grown up in relative comfort and security, thinking that this was an obvious outcome of progress and it was all right, proper, and natural.
Life is not that simple, though. Once the USSR disappeared — its disadvantages emphasized, its advantages never mentioned — there was no need any more to pamper the working class. The “Great Reset” was already underway but like a lot of social change its effects are uneven. The middle classes could look down on those Bolshie miners and claim that the Great Unwashed deserved their fate. But like Niemoller’s poem change eventually seeped up to those who thought that they were immune. This is now being debated as Covid related — but it most definitely is not. The “Great Reset” has been going on for years right under everyone’s noses. We just chose to ignore it.
The future has been here for some time and its in the form of a typical Central American country. There are effectively three classes of people. There a core group of family dynasties that essentially own all the wealth. These people are international in the sense that they easily move between favored locations regardless of where in the world they are. The next group are essentially those who service and maintain the core group. These tend to be the fiercest defenders of the system because they’re replaceable, they’ve got the most to lose and they’ve got people to look down on. Then there’s the rest who exist a bit like farm animals — possibly useful for creating wealth, irrelevant if not and generally ignored unless they cause trouble.
This type of system has been around for thousands of years in one form or another. Its very inefficient socially and in the use of resources. The key to changing it is education, health and life security which is why the key to maintaining it is to continually attack them as “too expensive”, “not relevant to business” and the Benthian notion that if someone is provided with a minimal standard of living as a right then they’ll likely to just be a layabout, depriving others of wealth and happiness. (Religion is also a valuable tool for maintaining the status quo — prophets may talk the talk about egalitarianism but their chosen advocates invariably preach conformity and acceptance of one’s lot with the promise of “Pie in the Sky” if you behave yourself.)

EstonIa Gov’t has just announced through a lawsuit that 78% of Estonian residents have natural immunity to covid. So if 50% (I don’t know what the exact figure is) of the people are faxed, then 89% of people supposedly have antibodies against covid. Doesn’t that mean we have reached heard immunity. Apparently not because we still need to run 40 PCR cycles to determine that people have sarscov2, which has never been isolated, and are a danger to society. The government here not only is propagandizing, by order from elsewhere, to create cognitive dissonance, it has cognitive dissonance itself.

The neighbor to the south Latvia: We have two choice separate the vaxed from the unvaxed or go into lockdown. We must go into another strict lockdown (seems like a Latvian go to). Talk about cognitive dissonance, Thankfully I didn’t end up in Lativa. 
But that is still much better than what is it like (being reported here) in Portugal, who brought in the army to force the vax on the population, “there is no choice, you get the vax or else.”. Talk about totalitarian state. I guess I would find out what “or else” means if I lived there.

To suggest that this is simply a ‘crisis of capitalism’ a rather blanket term doesn’t really explain what is happening or why. 
For instance the loan of free and easy capital which we have seen in recent years at almost 0% interest was also a feature during the 1920’s. It is the contraction of the money supply that led to austerity with the calling in of various loans that cause the crisis in liquidity. The same things happened in 1929 and 2008.
In fact 2008 saw a larger contraction of liquidity than that of 1929. 33% of all money in circulation was lost in 1929 and in 2008 it was over 40%. That is huge and a direct result of banks calling in loans and trying to service debts. 
The derivatives market alone means that in real terms the system is bust. That has been the case since 2008 and when it reached crisis point in 2019 the result of continually kicking the can down the road only thing keeping reality at bay was the pumping billions into system. As the piece suggests this reached breaking point when the money pumped into the REPO market simply was no longer enough to keep the market afloat on a daily basis. 
A year later and Covid comes along to save the day. Now with the distraction of a deadly virus the inflation and devalue of money can go on and everyone will blame covid as is what is happening first by inflation which is really the govt stealing money from the peoples bank accounts and then by contraction of the money supply through interest or the calling in of loans.
This is all the result of allowing private banks to create interest bearing money from nothing and the imposition of both the central bank system. Now the world bank and IMF things are run on a much larger scale. Hence all the bankrupting designed loans to render small countries and states in penury.
Of course the richer are getting richer they are the ones who run the system. As long as that is the case and it has been in America for well over a hundred years and in the UK for a lot longer all the end of the peer shows in Brighton or Manchester are just that. Puppet shows for the masses. They are meaningless because the puppets don’t run the system they are there to manage it for the money changers.
Until a govt of courage comes along and decides to issue its own currency at nominal charge and interest free the people of these islands will remain slaves to the money changers. Remember it was when Presidents Lincoln, Garfield and Kennedy had the gall to propose such changes i.e. the creation of govt money that the money changers took the ultimate sanction. 
We all argue about the circus that is politics in this country but is there ANYONE serious enough to take on the challenge? I think we all know the answer. 
Plus ca change ….

A great speech but Trump signed into law the biggest bailout in history $2Tn into law in 2020.
That stimulus will have to be repaid by Americans taxpayers so is more than socialisation for the banksters at the expense of working Americans. A huge transfer of wealth from the poorest to the richest Americans signed off on his watch.

Trump’s campaign policies made him the second most hated presidential candidate in history, the first being FDR). But unlike FDR, Trump did not carry out his policies because he became the slave of two rich and powerful Zionazi backers: Sheldon Adelson and Bibi Natan Yahoo. Instead of a New Deal he gave his countrymen The Art of The Deal. Pity.

Another meaty and important article Colin, thank you for this.
I’ll keep saying this until I’m blue in the face, but covid was the smokescreen; the Trojan horse, to usher in a Technocratic dystopian nightmare which also goes by the name The Great Reset.
One of the best analysis of this, and the intended future that is planned by these psychopathic freaks was the article ‘Klaus Schwab and His Great Fascist Reset’ which was published at Offguardian last year. I note Colin links this here as well.
The devastation and misery inflicted on so many lives in the last 18 months has been incalculable. And, sadly, these bastards have barely begun. A great many people will end up jobless and homeless.
And yes, how quickly Australia, and especially here in Victoria, has descended into a fascist police state. Surreal. But even more disturbing is how many here have fully gone along with this, and meekly bent over backwards to comply.
I wish everyone well and all the best for the next 9 days while the comments section is closed, and will just keep resisting this crap, no matter what.

We have now spent a long time wondering when the general public will wake up, but, quite apart from the unhappy conclusion many of us have come to – that they will never wake up – there is another sad fact to take into account:
If, by some miracle, something happened to make the public wake up next week, next month, or next year, the shock they would experience would probably destroy their minds.
We have to understand why the denial is so strong in those people who used to be our brothers and sisters. They are trying to protect themselves from the political equivalent of shell-shock. The end of the world.
At that level, it is understandable to ask, well, is it better to know than not to know…?
Just as people always consider it a blessing when somebody dies in their sleep… “Well, at least he didn’t suffer”…
This is existential, apocalyptic stuff. Not one of the usual ups and downs of life.
And it’s deliberately caused by criminals and their accomplices.

As you say, most people would have a devil of a time accepting what’s really going on. (I don’t know who’s worse off: those who cannot accept it or those, like me, who accept it too readily.)
I would say one (rather bizarre) thing about someone dying in their sleep. I had a dream that I was struggling, holding onto the rim of a ship and trying to work my way around to safety. I knew – I absolutely knew – that I would “die in my sleep” if I didn’t force myself to wake up – which I did (so I could tell everyone about it).
My point was that if I really had died in my sleep during that dream – it would NOT have been a peaceful death. It would have been no different from actually having a heart attack.

There actually is a “bottom line” to all this nonsense and madness – and it’s indescribably easy and simple to understand: the capitalist dominated world economy has never stopped crashing and never will.
Take a thousand pound steel ball to the top of Mount Everest. Then give it a push. It will roll down the mountain no matter how many barriers it encounters along the way. The many crags and twist and turns will slow it down; but in the end it will not stop till it reaches rock bottom.
Neither will elitist dominated capitalism. The “Great Reset” is nothing more than a final barrier erected by the elites to save their precious cash cow. But it can’t and won’t be saved no matter what.

What to write about — economics or keeping body and soul together?
I spent decades on the financial markets, the resource wars and power plays… and yet today even analysts find themselves writing not so much gas, as gaslighting.
Before I plunge back into money, asset, geopolitics and stuff, I took a look at what this Facebook saga tells us about the creation of reality. I sent my recent post at 5 am. I should have slept on it because the intro was missing. For those kind enough to read it and yet who wondered what the hell I was on about:
I didn’t study Baudrillard, I suck at philosophy; I’m still catching up with sci-fi, I mostly read the moderns; worst of all I’m a journalist so can I comment about propaganda while being ‘of’ it?
We experience reality at several removes — it seems to be true for many. The hacking of Twitch, a video game streamer, shows people pay $millions to snoop on the sense and emotion of others. In the same week Facebook blacked out, prompting a debate on the way it shapes our lives.
Only technology changes. For decades we’ve nodded at talking heads on TV going on about watching somebody else kick a ball.
Is something deeper being conveyed: the rules of the game, who we admit to our inner mind and the sweet little lies we let them tell? Ultimately, it shapes our consensus on truth and thus our world… our pandemic-locked-down lives.
Should it, even? The medium is the message, Marshall McLuhan had written five years before they put a man on the Moon.
We watched three men in a tin as they reached for a ball in the sky. We experienced them in a resolution lowered for the occasion, TV cameras at projector, colour de-graded to black and white.
The pandemic is the message — the United Nations has said as much but we must not accept those words without question, for they transmit alienation and disengagement in the words of the lyricist : “Planet Earth is blue and there’s nothing I can do.”

A rule of thumb: when our politicians (all main parties), media and state sanctioned talking head “experts” are in lockstep, using the same arguments, memes and imagery about anything at all then it is a PSYOP.
Anyone of note, especially politicians, who get out of (goose) step will be demonised by the global elite’s corporate media, see their donations and support dry up and see their reputations thrown in the gutter one way or the other – in short they will be cancelled. All politicians know this well and that is why it doesn’t matter which party holds government the main economic and environmental policies don’t change. The great unwashed are allowed to argue vigorously about things that don’t concern our global puppet masters, such as race, gender, and pronouns. In fact we are encouraged to do so by the media and academia they control, as these distractions are underwritten by them, so as to keep us divided, confused, frightened and ignorant of the true purpose of their “philanthropy” and social justice theatrics.
Nothing these puppet masters do is for our benefit, simply because they truly despise us, and secretly fear us; they creatively harvest our personal wealth, our common wealth and resources (true wealth), so as to maximise their control and power over us. That’s what it’s all about and that’s been their ambition for well over 100 years – total and absolute control of our body, mind and soul.
And now, their end game – their final solution is being played out in real time. Nil choices remain for we the people as their insidious end game becomes our line in the sand, our inevitable hill – the hill where we shall stand and fight on – and fight like hell we must …

Also expect an accompanying diversionary tactic with all the wokist terminology and Monbiot type ravings giving psychobabble accounts of how the Third Reich ascended via an abandonment of The Science, this being taken as one of innumerable “lessons from the past “. Expect also cosmic levels of obscurantism, gas lighting, and psy-ops of every description.

Why “Own nothing and be happy” is most likely bound to fail.
In some ways, owning nothing and renting sounds good. In others, it doesn’t because private ownership entails responsibility for one’s assets and vice versa. That notwithstanding, it could only work if there were enough shit to rent for everybody under affordable terms. Otherwise, people will have a tendency to hoard stuff for themselves, one way or another. The establishment can try to impose control, but the tension will continue to mount and sooner or later then system will crack up.

“It retains all the cruelties of the free market for those who live and work in the real world, but turns the paper economy into a state protectorate, surrounded by a kind of Trumpian Money Wall that is designed to keep the investor class safe from fear of loss.”– Matt Taibbi, 2020. BAD TRUMP. HE caused all this? Why of course!
Somehow I remember Obama/ Biden bailing out Wall Street to the tune of over $29 TRILLION after the crash of 2008 (the Levy Economics Institute, https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/op_23.pdf Nice precedent (and why squabble over $billions? Several Americans have more than that.)
Somehow I remember the Clintons abolishing Glass Steagall in 1999, to re-establish the financial gambling casinos which were stopped by that Act in 1933 to protect ordinary Americans and their money in banks.
Somehow I remember many dissenting voices (no longer allowed) questioning the establishment of the FED in 1913, and Nixon going off the Gold Standard in 1971.

One of the best and most comprehensive analyses of the state of the world I have seen.
It would make sense for the perpetrators of the current state of affairs and/or world leaders who are, perhaps with a shred of good faith, trying to steer the world through this to try to avoid a scenario where society collapsed into a state of chaos, some wholesale implosion and destruction. And to preserve the existing infrastructure for the prospective “own nothing be happy” world of semi-slavery. Hence CV.
Now, it’s obvious that not everybody will make it to the other side. Not under the present conditions. The current lifestyle is owed to debt – financial as well as ecological. Also dependent on the availability of cheap energy, the supply of which is limited. Plus, as the article correctly says, there won’t be a need for such a large workforce. There probably isn’t a need already now. In other words, the more people the less resources available to each of them – under economically balanced conditions. So, reducing the population makes perfect sense in this regard. Who and how will make it? Will people be pitted against one another through some nefarious concept along the lines of vaxxed/unvaxxed or something even more sinister? Everybody turned into an enemy? So as to prevent people from coming together and forming an opposition to where the PTBs are trying to steer the world? And what alternative do we have? A viable alternative that is, because what the article describes are the real issues, and things cannot be solved by getting rid of the covidian bullshit and going back to the old normal. For the old normal was fucked.
No matter what, consumption must be reduced, living standard will probably have to come down, people will have to find a new raison d’etre, other than hoarding material shit. Some of these theses are proposed by the Great Reset, which is probably why many otherwise well-meaning people find it appealing, oblivious to the sinister implications.
Supposing that there were an enlightened, well-meaning leader who understands the putrid state of affairs we’re in. What should he do? Stand before the people and say, “Sorry folks, the world is fucked up, on the verge of a collapse. We all have to tighten our belts, forget most of the perks we’ve had until now, and let’s try to build something better. It’s not gonna be as good as what we’ve had thus far, but it’s what it is”. People – mostly an entitled spoiled bunch – would probably tell him to go fuck himself.
The heretic thought creeps up – is it then that the covidian assholes are doing the right thing? Forcing people to behave?
Anybody has a solution as to how to get out of the collapse of our economic system? Which is probably largely attributable to Keynesian economics, this debt shit that has been so abused during the past century?

the Swiss Bank of International Settlements
It mite be Swiss geographically, but it’s not legally, or politically. The BIS has it’s own soverign territory inside Switzerland, like any foreign embassy, the staff enjoy dipolmatic immunity, and have their own passports.
Coulda saved a lot of words if he’d said lockdowns are a necessity to disguise global hyperinflationary signals by reducing the velocity of money. Thats sounds a bit snarkey, not meant that way, just wondered why no mention of money velocity.
Who owns the BIS? Central banks. Who owns the Central Banks? Can’t say, shareholders protected by official secrets acts! So we’re not allowed to know just who benefits personally from the interest on issuing the global means of exchange, to quote Bill Hicks “It’s a small club and you ain’t in it”.

Not to worry, I’ve worked it all out – using Science, Mathematics, Greta’s Diaries and all the latest technological creations. And after allowing for planetary shift and moon orbital drift, I’ve discovered who owns all the banks in the world.

I have been an electrician for nearly 50 years and a self employed electrical contractor for the last half of those years. I have always remained reasonably financially solvent throughout that time by turning a small profit. I started to smell a nasty dead rat some years ago when I caught an uber ride to the airport and it cost me less than what a taxi would have cost me 20 years beforehand. The new so called disruptive industries have never made a dollar profit in their lives and have survived on borrowed money and shafting the people who work for them. Well my wish is for a new disruptive industry coming to Australia soon, one where the working men and women of this land tell the guardians of this shit show to get fucked. Let them try and get the army and AI to fix that mess.

Thanks for posting. Indeed an interesting interview and, if Desmet is right, ultimately optimistic. He says everything totalitarianism does turns out to be a disaster, so I hope this applies to covid passports, and also that totalitarianism inevitably destroys itself in the end so we just need to keep safe, survive and wait for this to happen.

We’ve come full circle in Australia.
A vast land full of natural resources, stolen from the original inhabitants, raped, pillaged and sold off to foreign multi nationals.
A land settled by convicts and refugees, that has now returned to a prison state with internal passports run by corporate wanna bees and their head kickers.
If only Iceland wasn’t so fucking cold.

One missing bit is that I suspect much of the trillions handed directly to blackrock has been used to buy controlling shares in areas of high employment, key industries and anywhere supply chains could be disrupted,,,,that is without how it has obviously been also used to bribe various politicians….or influencers of politicians….
this nicely sets the scene for the phase where we are now….controlling large no’s of employees they can push mandates knowing workers will not comply and a largish % will walk thus causing all sorts of chaos which we are seeing already….and owning supply chains they can threaten lower pay or whatever to force more disruption….
I seriously doubt many actually understand how this is happening and how it is being done directly to control demolish many economies..the top echelon apparently need this to force us on the lower end to pay the price….so all nicely planned and much hidden under covid…
today I noted to the gals in the supermarket that aust is having a lot of difficulty exporting lots of fruit from Victoria…info freely available on the net but most are so busy carrying about marks etc this is all being ignored….my guess these farmers will be joining the other businesses in aust out the back door..this is happening because containers are not available…who owns the containers?…..being blamed on covid not the container owners……great excuse..no reports in general media…any wake up will be far too late for most and the politicians will have taken their handsome pensions and payoffs and quietly disappeared..
incidentally thanks for mentioning 1893 and small pox plus financial disaster….interesting astrology there too….they obviously learnt from that one and got the virus in early..well the astrology encouraged them to do it that way this time…

Excellent analysis. Good, old-fashioned Marxist political economy. Reminds me of Friedrich Engels work, The Condition of the Working Class in England 1844.
 He wrote: 
”How is it possible, under such conditions, for the lower classes to be healthy and long-lived? What else can be expected other than an excessive mortality, an unbroken series of epidemics, a progressive deterioration in the physical structure of the working population … That the dwellings of the workers in the worst portion of the cities of life of this class, engender numerous diseases, is attested on all sides … It has been asserted, with perfect truth, that lung diseases must be the inevitable consequence of such conditions, and that, indeed, cases of this kind are disproportionately in the working people’s districts, is in the highest degree favourable to the development of consumption (TB) frequent in that class …” (p.109)
Engels wrote this when he was only 25. We should take it as a warning. Today it remains a searing indictment of neoliberal capitalism endemic in the Global South and increasingly in the ‘developed’ world. Moreover it is only three or four of generations in the global north since Engels polemic. The neo-liberal global offensive against the metropolitan classes in now in full swing. It is an ideological offensive designed to disarm the masses and return them to abject slavery with no political or economic rights. 
Tell me I am wrong.

The above analysis is what I would have expected from the Left. That not only did it NOT come from them but was vehemently barred BY them convinced me that they too were part of the manoeuvre.
But the above explication is IT!.The bottom line which must surely be increasingly evident as time goes on. Anyone who still thinks this is about a virus is displaying a level of stupidity so obstinate as to be criminal.

As someone who intensely watches the rigged “markets,” the good news may be that our Overlords were forced to cross the Rubicon before they had all their ducks in a row. It appeared to me that they were aiming more for 2030. One might also argue though that the year 2030 was the goalpost where they had depopulated the planet of useless eaters (i.e. 95% of the population) and turned the remainder into transhuman asexual GMO cyborgs.

Sorry, a bit off topic, but in the big picture still relevant. I was living in Connecticut on September 11, 2001, working for a nurses’ organisation. First all it was unbelievable, literally. Second, the organisation starting getting together busloads of nurses to go to NYC and help with all the injured. It turned out there weren’t any. Strange.
For me, the biggest worry was September 12. According to all the insurrectionist’s handbooks, (in particular the Russian Revolution), step two after the violence was the takeover of all telecommunications. But nothing like that happened either. Instead the narrative was taken over by the usual media and the chilling message, ‘you’re either for us or against us.’ Also strange.
I was perplexed and have remained perplexed until recently when it became apparent that step two has been a rather slow, twenty year project (and on into the future). Mainstream media is fully on board the several narratives Globo Cap is setting out. The thing is I think they thought it would be easy to build up digital media, hate speech, etc. And I guess it has been, but I doubt they expected so much pushback. I guess they didn’t realise just how effectively their own weapons of control would be turned against them by various platforms. (Go OG!) That may be why their threats are beginning to sound so desperate and so hollow.

A much more insightful article than most.
What might bake your noodle is to realise that The Federal Reserve ponzi was created in foreknowledge of The Great Reset.
Bear in mind that money is ephemeral.
When it comes to financial shenanigans on this global scale, the investigative principle that one should ‘follow the money’ is no longer helpful. One has to follow or find the buildings, i.e. determine that to which the labour obtained from peculation has been covertly diverted.

Philip Alston, the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty, accused ministers of being in a state of denial about the impact of policies. He accused them of the “systematic immiseration of a significant part of the British population”.
State of “denial” or of “not giving a flying fuck”?

First, the “ministers” are far from the sharpest knives in the rack. They are simply given talking points and told what to say and how to try to rebut the accusations of the oppressed. I suspect that most of the them are not so entirely stupid that they are oblivious to the actual agenda behind their mandates (just following orders), and they are aware that their impact was exactly what was needed to further the agenda. Besides being dull, they are also without exception sociopaths. I believe that they must test positive over a period of weeks for the rt-PCR sociopath test. If it test for full blown psychopathy, they are fast tracked for the PM spot.
