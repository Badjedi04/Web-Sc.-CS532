Its a commie takeover pushed by the Jesuit banksters and their muppets. Jesuits killed some Popes (Clement , JP1) fired some bullets Pope JP2, killed many presidents Lincoln/JFK, Kings Louis16/Czar etc, created the Soviet Union, financed Hitler, Stalin, Mao PolPot, started WW1/WW2, behind Russian/French/US Revolutions out of revenge and now Europe. They want us to worship them as they think they are gods. If you dont bow down, your the enemy.
