American Horror Story actress Sarah Paulson is facing the wrath of the cancel culture mob for refusing to put her pronouns in her Twitter bio.
The cancel mob descended after Sarah Paulson fired back at a random Twitter user who had ordered the Emmy-winning actress to declare her pronouns. Paulson replied that she didn’t like being told “what do do.”



It’s also not that hard for you to not tell what to do 🏼‍♀️
— Sarah Paulson (@MsSarahPaulson) March 31, 2021
Her retort prompted a wave of angry insults calling the actress a “bitch,” “cunt,” and “whore.” Some even attacked Paulson’s partner, Two and a Half Men actress Holland Taylor.

Others criticized Paulson for refusing to declare her pronouns on the official Trans Day of Visibility.

Sarah Paulson previously egged on a cancel mob that targeted author J.K. Rowling for her views on transgenderism. The actress told Rowling to “shut up” and supported calling the author a “transmisogynist.”


Oh yes. YES YESSSSSSS https://t.co/0yxK7jtsRv

Word. Goodnight and shut up @jk_rowling https://t.co/Cz0U6EmPfj

Despite being in a relationship with actress Holland Taylor, and before that to actress Cherry Jones, Paulson has stated she doesn’t like being defined as a lesbian. “If my life choices had to be predicated based on what was expected of me from a community on either side, that’s going to make me feel really straitjacketed, and I don’t want to feel that,” Paulson told the New York Times in 2016.







Paulson has used her Twitter account with more than 1.1 million followers to repeatedly attack then President Donald Trump. She promoted the ultimately unsuccessful effort to flip Texas blue and even said she would be happy to play Trump in a future season of American Horror Story.
Paulson is next set to appear as Linda Tripp in the next season of American Crime Story, which will focus on the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
