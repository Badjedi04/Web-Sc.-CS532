Since January of this year, our nation has been found in a battle with a virus that we are told began in Communist China in an area called Wuhan.  Some wonder if maybe this was done on purpose while others believe that this virus was allowed out to eliminate the older people in China.  It would not be the first time China has killed their own people to get rid of certain groups. But let us take a look at what China really is.  We know for a fact that China is a Communist nation. We also know that many factories are based in the lower floors of apartments where the employees stay up above and work down below. We questioned a few Chinese people while on a cruise to find out that it is very true that many workers are forced to live above the factories so they can be controlled by the government.  China owns all industry.  They do not have private firms working within Communist China and a few United States companies found this out recently when they were going to send needed supplies to the US from their factories in China and China said they could not do that.
Let us take a look at Communist China’s history and remember, under Xi Jinping, it has been revived!

“The Communist Party of China (CPC)[note 2] is the founding and ruling political party of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the second largest political party in the world. The CPC is the sole governing party within mainland China, permitting only eight other, subordinated parties to co-exist, those making up the United Front. It was founded in 1921, chiefly by Chen Duxiu and Li Dazhao. The party grew quickly, and by 1949 it had driven the Kuomintang (KMT)’s nationalist government from mainland China after the Chinese Civil War, leading to the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. It also controls the world’s largest armed forces, the People’s Liberation Army.”
Here we see the beginning of the Communist Party of China. What is not revealed here are the millions of Chinese that were killed to establish the power of the Communist Party. The numbers are staggering because the total amount is more than the amount of people now in the United States!  It’s hard to imagine that since 1949, the Communist Chinese have killed around 490 MILLION of its own people! One does not have to believe what we wrote here.  Simply go here to discover the truth for yourself.


Since 1949, the establishment of the PRC, at least 490 million (including forced abortions) people have been killed by the Chinese Communist Party. If including the Civil War of China during 1927–1936, and 1947–1949, the CCP would responsible for another 20 million people’s death. Therefore, the total population lost would increase to at least 510 million.
How could such a political group hold life so irrelevant? It is easy for the Communist Chinese since they have billions of people and a mere 500 million would not hurt their population. China has just begun to allow 2 children to a family because they were getting too many males.  Most of the female babies would be aborted because they had little use to the military might of China. You see, the Communist Chinese only have one major objective and will continually go after that idea no matter what the cost, and that is world domination. Please go back to World War 2 to understand why world domination is not good for anyone. Nazi Germany had that idea and the murder and destruction of nations show what that was.  Today, China is not far from that, but the Chinese elite are extremely good at disguising their intentions because they will gladly pat you on the back while holding a knife!
Let’s continue on with what the Communist Chinese really are.
“The CPC is officially organized on the basis of democratic centralism, a principle conceived by Russian Marxist theoretician Vladimir Lenin which entails democratic and open discussion on policy on the condition of unity in upholding the agreed upon policies. The highest body of the CPC is the National Congress, convened every fifth year. When the National Congress is not in session, the Central Committee is the highest body, but since the body meets normally only once a year most duties and responsibilities are vested in the Politburo and its Standing Committee. The party’s leader recently holds the offices of General Secretary (responsible for civilian party duties), Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) (responsible for military affairs) and State President (a largely ceremonial position). Through these posts, the party leader is the country’s paramount leader. The current paramount leader is General Secretary Xi Jinping, elected at the 18th Central Committee held on 15 November 2012.” 
Check out the blue highlighted part of the above paragraph, it shows what we in the United States are now fighting to avoid: democratic centralism. Although Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer do not outwardly state this, if you look at their ideology, it closely follows this point made by the Communist Party of China! Notice how the ideas of Marxist Lenin seem to blend well with the Democratic Party’s ideas? How did we allow this to get this far along?  How did we allow our nation to begin following this ideology? Check out a prior article that explains that.
Our nation has gone under some very damaging “transformation” since 1856 and the Democrats have been a big part of the downhill lean.
Communist China is not what they appear to be and their disguise is constantly being changed so as to hide their ideology until they are ready to take over the world.
“The CPC is committed to communism and continues to participate in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers’ Parties each year. According to the party constitution, the CPC adheres to Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, socialism with Chinese characteristics, Deng Xiaoping Theory, the Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook on Development, and Xi Jinping Thought. The official explanation for China’s economic reforms is that the country is in the primary stage of socialism, a developmental stage similar to the capitalist mode of production. The command economy established under Mao Zedong was replaced by the socialist market economy under Deng Xiaoping, the current economic system, on the basis that “Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth”.” 
The Xi Jinping Thought
Wonder what that is? It is interesting and clicking on that will show you that Xi Jinping cannot be trusted as far as one could pick him up and throw him. Go back to the beginning of this paragraph and notice what is called Workers’ Party.  Is it strange that the same type of Workers’ Party exists in the United States and they are strong supporters of both Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer? Communist China bases its economy on the idea that “Practice is the Sole Criterion for the Truth.”  Now, we have to wonder if maybe the truth part only applies to their economic theory, it sure does not apply to allowing truth out of its nation. Below, see a direct quote from Xi Jinping.
“[…] their theory that capitalism is the ultimate has been shaken, and socialist development has experienced a miracle. Western capitalism has suffered reversals, a financial crisis, a credit crisis, a crisis of confidence, and their self-conviction has wavered. Western countries have begun to reflect, and openly or secretively compare themselves against China’s politics, economy and path.”
—Xi Jinping, the CCP general secretary, on the inevitability of socialism.[133]
^Buckley, Chris (13 February 2014). “Xi Touts Communist Party as Defender of     Confucius’s Virtues”. The New York Times. Archived from the original on 22 February 2014. Retrieved 13 February 2014.
Notice how Xi Jinping seems to be working toward the end goal of obtaining his style of “Socialism” to the Western world!
Let us look at the next paragraph of Communist China history, here is where it gets very interesting. 
“Since the collapse of Eastern European communist governments in 1989–1990 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, the CPC has emphasized its party-to-party relations with the ruling parties of the remaining socialist states. While the CPC still maintains party-to-party relations with non-ruling communist parties around the world, since the 1980s it has established relations with several non-communist parties, most notably with ruling parties of one-party states (whatever their ideology), dominant parties in democracies (whatever their ideology) and social democratic parties.”
The most important part of this paragraph comes near the end where it is shown where the Communist Party of China “establishes relations with several non-communist parties.”  Notice, once again, the last three words, “social democratic parties.”  Here it is clear that we have the Communist Chinese helping out, working with or in relationship with Socialist Democratic Parties. Does the Democratic Socialist Party here in the USA become a part of Communist Chinas’ influence? Could Bernie Sanders be part of the Communist Chinese influence in the Democratic Party here in the United States?  It does bring questions into being that need to be answered!
We just have to look into the people associated with China to see what they are doing to help China keep their secrets about the Communist Chinese Wuhan Virus. Did Communist China have their spy sitting in Dianne Feinstein’s office to see what the United States is doing that they may be able to twist to their advantage? Why has no one called Senator Dianne Feinstein to the mat for having a Communist Chinese spy working in her office? One does not have to dig deep into Nancy Pelosi’s background to find ties to the Workers Party or to Communist China.  Maybe that is why she favors Communist China over United States citizens, but in either case, we must take a close look at many in Congress and the Senate and find those who receive funds or help from the Communist Chinese. One would be stunned by the names associated with Communist China and those that support China the most are the very ones that obtain help from China in one form or another.
Communist China has held its secrets close to the vest but the fact that they have killed over 400 million of its own citizens shows that they have no value for life but only for the Communist Party. We should be very wary of the Communist Chinese since they are working hard to destroy our nation from within. It is not unusual to see a headline where someone was working in some government office and spying for Communist China, Diane Feinstien is a glaring example of how close the Communist Chinese will place their spies to find and seek information they need to replicate our military might and they spare no expense to do that, in some cases using grant money the Congress gives to them to spy on us.
Communist China does not wish to help our nation, they wish to captivate it, to take it over little by little. They send their students here not just to learn but, in most cases, to take pictures of our infrastructure so the military can find where we are weak at should they ever decide to invade our nation. Communist China is not our friend. Check out the oath to the Communist Party below.
“It is my will to join the Communist Party of China, uphold the Party’s program, observe the provisions of the Party constitution, fulfill a Party member’s duties, carry out the Party’s decisions, strictly observe Party discipline, guard Party secrets, be loyal to the Party, work hard, fight for communism throughout my life, be ready at all times to sacrifice my all for the Party and the people, and never betray the Party.”
—Communist Party admission oath[101]”
This shows how determined the Communist Chinese are to follow their leaders with no free will at all. The people of the United States should be proud that we do not make our people take an oath like this, unless of course, it is for military duty. Their oath even shows they will fight for Communism and that is beyond what United States Citizens have ever done.
Look at yet another gem from the Communist Chinese.
Main article: Ideology of the Communist Party of China
“Since 1978 China has to a certain extent shifted its political philosophical discourse. But this shift has brought us closer to classical Marxism. For example, classical Marxism expresses the relationship between economics and politics, and further, the economic base and superstructure where the latter is determined fundamentally by the former and only under certain limited conditions can the latter shape the former. Both Stalin and Mao, however, believed that politics and the superstructure could, at any moment, fundamentally determine economics, that they could determine absolutely the economic base. In a word, for whatever reason both Stalin and Mao misunderstood this vital point in Marxist theory and suffered accordingly in practice.”
—Jiexiong Yi, a senior Marxist researcher at Beijing University and the Central Party School.[110]
We see that Communist China uses Marxism and Socialism to reach its goals of Communism. Here, in our nation, we have the Democratic Socialist Party with Bernie Sanders at the head of the organization and many followers who follow like blind mice. How many of those followers would follow if they really understood what Socialism leads to because socialism is just a stepping stone in their hierarchy of Communism. The gem below will blow many people’s minds.
“I am a Marxist. The essence of Marxism is change, […] Barack Obama beat Hillary Clinton by stressing change. The Marxist in China today is not a stubborn, dogmatic, and outdated 19th-century old man, but a dynamic, pro-change, young thinker. We have a flexible approach: if Marx‘s words are still applicable, we will use them; for things he did not articulate clearly, we will spell them out; for what he did not say, we will boldly come up with something new.”
—Ye Xiaowen on the role of Marxist thought.[115]
In this example of the road to Communism, it is clearly shown how the “change” spoke of by former President Obama is an “essence of Marxism.”  We clearly see that the change that Obama really wanted was the Marxist view he came to know and like while at Occidental College.
As a nation, we have to make sure we can clearly see that other nations are our friends and those who harbor Communist ideology while discussing free enterprise should be approached as one would approach a tiger with a hand full of meat, very cautious. If we do not look at the inner workings and ideologies of other nations, we are doomed to fall into a trap that will destroy our nation from within. Maybe this Communist Chinese Wuhan Virus will allow us to reexamine our Chinese counterparts to make sure we are not being misled by a bunch of Communists just to fit their ideals.
Xi Jinping, the dictator of Communist China, does cause one to wonder how anyone could trust such a person who has closed China to nearly everything.
“Xi Jinping[note 2] (/ʃiː dʒɪnˈpɪŋ/; Chinese: 习近平; Mandarin pronunciation: [ɕǐ tɕîn.pʰǐŋ]; born 15 June 1953) is a Chinese politician serving as the general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC). Xi has been the paramount leader, the highest-ranking official in China, since 2012 and he officially received the title of “leadership core” from the CPC in 2016.
The son of Chinese Communist veteran Xi Zhongxun, he was exiled to rural Yanchuan County as a teenager following his father’s purge during the Cultural Revolution, and lived in a cave in the village of Liangjiahe, where he worked as the party secretary. After studying at the Tsinghua University as a “Worker-Peasant-Soldier student“, Xi rose through the ranks politically in China’s coastal provinces. Xi was governor of Fujian from 1999 to 2002. He was also governor, then party secretary of neighbouring Zhejiang from 2002 to 2007. Following the dismissal of the party secretary of Shanghai Chen Liangyu, Xi was transferred to replace him for a brief period in 2007. He joined the Politburo Standing Committee and central secretariat in October 2007, spending the next five years as Chinese paramount leader Hu Jintao’s presumed successor. Xi was vice president from 2008 to 2013 and vice chairman of the Central Military Commission from 2010 to 2012.
Xi is the first general secretary born after the establishment of the People’s Republic of China. Since assuming power, Xi has introduced far-ranging measures to enforce party discipline and to impose internal unity. His anti-corruption campaign has led to the downfall of prominent incumbent and retired Communist Party officials, including members of the Politburo Standing Committee. He has also enacted or promoted more assertive foreign policy, particularly with regard to China–Japan relations, China’s claims in the South China Sea, and its advocacy for free trade and globalization. He has sought to expand China’s African and Eurasian influence through the Belt and Road Initiative.
As the central figure of the fifth generation of leadership of the People’s Republic,[2] Xi has significantly centralized institutional power by taking on a wide range of leadership positions, including chairing the newly formed National Security Commission, as well as new steering committees on economic and social reforms, military restructuring and modernization, and the Internet. Xi’s political thoughts have been written into the party and state constitutions.[3] His tenure has also seen a significant increase of censorship and mass surveillance, significant deterioration in human rights, the return to a cult of personality and the removal of term limits for the President in 2018. Due to these factors, Xi has been called a “dictator” by many political observers.[a]”
Notice the many things that Xi Jinping has done to “control” his people like slaves to the government. In the last part above, one sees where Xi Jinping has declared himself as the leader with no new elections. Xi has also destroyed human rights, caused an increase in censorship, mass surveillance, and heaven knows what else because Xi has shut the doors of openness down in China and taken a very hard Communist rule.
In closing, we have to ask due to the stated observations above, is China our friend or our enemy?
Looking over their ideas, their theories, and their actions we can draw no other conclusion then to state that China is not our friend, but our enemy and they should be treated as such.  The United States should hold them at arms distance from any of our military projects. We have to take all the manufacturing jobs that China has stolen from us and bring them back here to the United States. Communist China pays very little for their workers due to the fact that the workers obtain nearly all they need from the Communist Chinese government.
If asked, should we trust the Chinese, we would answer in a firm “No.”
In the end, we as a nation should ask ourselves, is Communist China our friend or our foe?
