Elon Musk Goes All In On Jan. 6 Denial

Sara Boboltz at HuffPost: Twitter CEO Elon Musk on Tuesday joined the right-wing chorus denying that a violent riot took place at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, after Fox News aired cherry-picked footage of the incident provided by Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.Replying to the communications director of a Freedom Caucus-aligned organization who alleged that members of the House committee investigating the riot had lied, Elon took to his social media platform to write: “Besides misleading the public, they withheld evidence for partisan political reasons that sent people to prison for far more serious crimes than they committed. That is deeply wrong, legally and morally.”“This is crazy. The public was misled,” Musk said in a separate tweet about the footage, which aired Monday on Fox News host Tucker Carlson’s show.After right-wing conspiracy theorist Mike Cernovich wrote that “the Big Lie of the January 6th” had been “exposed,” Musk replied, “Shocking indeed.”And in response to a Twitter user who accused the BBC of not covering “the Jan 6 new evidence,” Musk tweeted at one of the broadcaster’s accounts, writing: “What say you, @BBCWorld? Your credibility is at stake.”Other commentary came over the course of several hours early Tuesday, shortly after Musk, the world’s richest person, suggested that he uses Twitter while on the toilet for long periods.Right-wing wanker Twitter CEO Elon Musk joined in the Capitol Insurrection denialism in the wake of Tucker Carlson’s selectively released videos about that day
