The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.” Zephaniah 3:17
As I grew up as a young boy, my brother was pretty much all I had around me and I was, and am, thankful for that in a big way, even today.
My mom wasn’t around much, she was a work alcoholic and spent much of her time with her boyfriends, and it seemed that me and my brother were always in the way.

I didn’t know my dad because he was never a part of our lives so, we didn’t really know what we were missing, if anything at all.
Often, when seeing kids with their families, I always wondered what it was like to have a dad and mom together, to have family time.


I especially wondered what it would be like to have a cool dad, what it would be like to have that sort of relationship to hang out with him, to have fun with him, to cry with him but have never had the opportunity to do so.
When I got saved, I mean really saved at 28, that is where the Lord broke me down to nothing to show me that He was and is my everything (Isaiah 66:2).
I soon came to the realization that I have a Father, one which was in Heaven.  Who could ask for anything greater than that? One thing I always wondered for years is, what is the relationship like between us and our Father.
Recently, I came across a video, a video of a father and son singing a song together that was sent to me by one of my friends that I watched over and over again. I took particular notice of the son looking at the father and the father looking at the son. Though the song is awesome, it really is, I do not mean to be cheesy here in any way, but the love that they had for each other, in my heart, took precedent in every way.
It seems to be a touch of Heaven, a glimpse into the heart of God the Father and the Son for us on this earth. What are your thoughts? Enjoy!
