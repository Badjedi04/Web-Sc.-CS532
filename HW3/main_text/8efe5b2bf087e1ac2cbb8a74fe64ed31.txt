Man slashes Jewish family — dad, mom and 1-year-old — in  ManhattanBy Geller Report Staff - on April 1, 2021

We’re in hell.
The slasher was on parole for attempted murder, thanks to the Democrats “criminal justice reforms.” The knife-wielding man was actually on parole for attempted murder. He randomly attacked a Hassidic Jewish couple and their one-year old while walking in lower Manhattan. The suspect slashed all three family members, cops and police sources said. Crime is increasing rapidly in New York City, due to the anti-police and pro-criminal policies enacted by Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio. This is why thousands of New Yorkers are leaving the once great city.
No mention in press reports (the little there is) of the family’s visible Judaism. Woke is antisemitic.



Crime in New York City last week was up FORTY PERCENT compared to the same time last year, says @BillOReilly.

Man slashes dad, mom and 1-year-old in Lower Manhattan
By New York Post, April 1, 2021
A knife-wielding man on parole for attempted murder randomly attacked a Hassidic couple walking with their 1-year-old in Lower Manhattan on Wednesday — slashing all three family members, cops and police sources said.
The family of three was taking a stroll on State Street near Battery Park at about 5:50 p.m. when the maniac passed by — and then turned around and came at them with a blade, according to sources and the NYPD.
He slashed the father on the head, the mother on the lip and the baby on the chin, the officials said.
The unhinged creep ran after the family, who fled with their baby in a stroller, the sources said.
Sources said the loon was ranting during the attack, though the victims told cops that he said nothing that was anti-Semitic.
 
All three of the victims were treated for minor cuts by first responders on the scene and declined further medical attention.
A 30-year-old parolee was arrested in the assault and cops recovered the knife after canvassing the area, the sources said.

The man was released from jail last month. He spent several years behind bars after pleading guilty to attempted murder tied to a violent August 2011 robbery on the Upper East Side, according to the sources.
Charges were pending late Wednesday and an investigation was ongoing.
