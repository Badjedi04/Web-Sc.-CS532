Gallup Chairman warns Biden “42 Million Want to Migrate to U.S.”
by Jim Clifton, Gallup, March 24, 2021:
Here are questions every leader should be able to answer regardless of their politics: How many more people are coming to the southern border? And what is the plan?


There are 33 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Roughly 450 million adults live in the region. Gallup asked them if they would like to move to another country permanently if they could.
A whopping 27% said “yes.”
This means roughly 120 million would like to migrate somewhere.
Gallup then asked them where they would like to move.
Of those who want to leave their country permanently, 35% — or 42 million — said they want to go to the United States.
Seekers of citizenship or asylum are watching to determine exactly when and how is the best time to make their move.

In addition to finding a solution for the thousands of migrants currently at the border, let’s include the bigger, harder question — what about all of those who would like to come? What is the message to them?
What is the 10-year plan?
330 million U.S. citizens are wondering. So are 42 million Latin Americans.
