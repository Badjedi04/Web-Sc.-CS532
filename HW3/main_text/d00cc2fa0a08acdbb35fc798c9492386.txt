Useful idiots are simpletons, socialists, revolutionaries, if you will. They do not recognize their purpose in the hands of the enemy that facilitates and uses them because they chose for themselves the role of servile accomplices of their function in fooling the American people (they are fulfilling their function of placing the masses at the mercy of the criminals that they are subservient-sold out too) until it is too late – in the end, their own demise (The country and themselves)(Psalm 7:15).
I’m sure most are now aware of the Center For Disease Control’s new statistics concerning deaths and adverse side effects from the experimental vaccines (Leviticus 17:11).  These people have no credibility.  Of course, this has been sold to you as the end-all of end-alls.
On top of this, you never heard a word of any of this from the mainstream media (Psalm 101:3).

And I am sure you haven’t heard a word of the man’s skin recently peeling off in a reaction to Johnson and Johnson’s new experimental injection because the big tech companies and the mainstream media and their useful idiots remain silent or are just blatantly censoring this information (Proverbs 17:15).
You probably didn’t hear a word from the doctors that are sending out a “dire warning” not to take the vaccines. That’s because it does not fit their criminal and fraudulent narrative when it comes to these dangerous vaccines (Ephesians 4:14).

You surely didn’t hear one of them tell you that the same ones selling you the virus are the same ones that are selling you the vaccine (Isaiah 5:20).



But what you did hear was MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough doing his best to cover for the conspirators (Jeremiah 11:9).


Breitbart News reported:
MSNBC “Morning Joe” host Joe Scarborough on Tuesday addressed the pushback to the government forcing the people to wear masks or carry passports as proof of vaccination after President Joe Biden urged the American people to continue wearing masks and CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky warned of “impending doom.”
This comes as states are relaxing restrictive measures due to the increasing number of citizens receiving their COVID-19 vaccinations, and cases are dropping.
Scarborough called the people resisting the government overreach “lunatics” and “idiots.” He then invoked Jesus, saying those who are not doing everything to prevent the spread of the virus are “doing the opposite” of what Jesus taught.
“I’m now hearing lunatics — and I’ll call them lunatics — that are now, of course, still pushing back on the masks. But now we’re saying if we somehow have something that identifies us as having a vaccine, we’re like part of Satan or the mark of the Devil — or Nazi Germany,” Scarborough outlined. “The idiocy is just beyond us. They’re acting recklessly and irresponsibly. They’re being stupid. They’re following conspiracy theories.”

Conclusion: Friends, these useful idiots have been tolerated far too long concerning their illegal efforts in advocating what the government says no matter what (The mainstream media operatives have in fact, a long history of attempting to cover for conspirators) (Luke 12:2), and covering for and even going so far as to attack the people that are holding to the law and the U.S. Constitution.
These fools, and fools they are, need to be held accountable for their crimes against the people in this country in the same way that the corrupt politicians need to be held accountable (Romans 1:22).
