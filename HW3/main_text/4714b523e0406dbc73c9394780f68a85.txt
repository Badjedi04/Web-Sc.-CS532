“Power is not only what you have but what the enemy thinks you have.” -Saul Alinsky 
Dictators of the past and dictators in the present are using the same method.  There is nothing new under the sun (Ecclesiastes 1:9).  They all act just like their father the devil (John 8:44): cause the enemies (The righteous), the American people (As well as those globally), to believe that the minority is the majority and the majority is the minority (Isaiah 5:20).
This is how they get away with that which they get away. The people are led, somehow or another, with the information through the mainstream media that the majority are for breaking the law (Exodus 20) and are for the said representatives that are stripping the people of their God-given rights. Nothing could be further from the truth.
This video has been made to liberate the mind of the people into understanding how the small portion of the wicked (Despots, Tyrants, Dictators work hand-in-glove with the Mainstream Media’s Useful Idiots etc…) on a global basis and how it is that they mean to rule the masses (Jeremiah 17:5).
