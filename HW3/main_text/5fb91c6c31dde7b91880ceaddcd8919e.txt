Ph.D Student’s Thesis Presents Scientific Evidence Earth Is Flat








Share4KRedditTweetTelegramMoreEmail4K Shares




Yeah, it’s not a joke. A Ph.D. Student has presented a thesis claiming the Earth is FLAT, stationary, the center of the universe and only around 13,500 years old. Yup, you read right. The thesis was submitted to two assessors, thus passing the first stage of approvals.

The idea that the Earth is ‘Flat’ is, in fact, a relatively new theory. In fact, before anyone came up with the idea we live on a flat plane, people knew very well the Earth was round.
﻿
Even though there are countless images of our planet, and numerous videos which have been recorded from space, there are still some who argue the Earth is in fact flat.  One of them is a Ph.D. student who rocked the Arab scientific community when she presented her thesis claiming the Earth is FLAT, stationary, the center of the universe and only around 13,500 years old. Yup, you read right.

Not only did he suggest we live on a flat Earth, he also rejected scientific theories presented by Newton and Einstein, astronomical discoveries made by Copernicus and Kepler, the Big Bang theory, atmospheric and geological activity, most of modern climatology, and basically all other scientific teachings made in the past.
﻿
According to an article written by the Gulf News, the student presented her thesis after a staggering five years of work. Eventually, it was submitted to two assessors, thus passing the first stage of approvals. The reports were expected soon, for the thesis defense to be scheduled.

This ‘shocking’ doctoral thesis suggests that the planet we live on is flat, very young and that it remains stationary at the MIDDLE of the universe. Furthermore—if that wasn’t enough—the thesis claims that the Sun has an average diameter of 1,135 kilometers and NOT 1.4 million km. The moon has a width of 908km, and are located 687 and 23 times closer to Earth respectively. In addition, the thesis claims there are 11 planets and STARS in the sky are LIMITED in number and have a diameter of 292 kilometers and not millions of kilometers.

In the meantime, the President of the Tunisian Astronomical Association somehow managed to get his hands on a leaked copy of the thesis, proving it was not a hoax and posted in on Facebook.
As noted by Gulf News, many people consider these claims ridiculous, and scandalous since the thesis firmly rejects ALL modern science. Others, however, have found it extremely disturbing since the thesis was written by a Ph.D. science student, and the professor is the ‘highest’ in academia.
Furthermore, Gulf News adds: “Indeed, we find in the conclusions of the thesis clear indications of this stand and approach, expressions such as: “using physical and religious arguments”, “also proving the world scale of [Noah’s] flood”, “proposed a new kinematic approach that conforms to the verses of the Quran”, “the roles of the stars are: (1) to be ornaments of the sky; (2) to stone the devils; and (3) as signs to guide creatures in the darkness of earth”; and finally “the geo-centric model… accords with the verses of the Quran and the pronouncements of our Prophet.”

Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
