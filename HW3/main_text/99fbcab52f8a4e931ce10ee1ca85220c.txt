ShareTweetSharePinLucia Whalen Bremer, a 13-year-old girl described by those who knew her as “brave, hardworking, and kind to everyone,” was reportedly shot dead while walking in a Virginia suburb on Friday by a thug suspect who may get off easy and have his identity hidden forever because he’s a “juvenile.”
From The Daily Mail, “Teenage boy is charged with murder of eighth-grade girl who was shot multiple times in Virginia”:

She was shot multiple times on Friday afternoon at the Gayton Forest West subdivision and died at an area hospital soon after.



Police said the suspected shooter fled the scene immediately after opening fire and was arrested on Saturday afternoon about a half-mile away.
His name has not been released due to his age but he is said to be facing charges including second-degree homicide, possession of a firearm by juvenile, and use of a firearm in the commission of a felony, according to the Henrico Citizen.
Bremer’s family, who run a local produce business called Liberty Tree Farm, announced her death in a Facebook statement on Saturday.




Quioccasin Middle School Principal Melanie Phipps released a heartfelt statement remembering Bremer.
‘Lucia was funny. She loved to tell jokes and made people laugh. She was an amazing public speaker, and you would just listen in awe as she spoke. Lucia was wise beyond her years. Talking to her didn’t feel like talking to a middle schooler,’ Phipps wrote.
‘Lucia was exceptional; truly one-of-a-kind. She was brave, hardworking, and kind to everyone. Her smile would light up the entire room.
‘In fact, her mother told me that Lucia’s name means “light”, which is just the perfect way to describe her. She radiated happiness, and she loved our school.’
“Witnesses reported seeing two girls walking along a path, followed by the suspect, then hearing at least five shots,” The Henrico Citizen reported. “The suspect ran from the scene, while one of the girls fell after being struck. She later died at a local hospital.”

The overwhelming majority of media reports on the shooting neglected to give a description of the suspect but the Henrico Citizen reported that “police described the suspect as a young Black male with bushy hair shaved on the sides, about 5 foot 8 in height with a slight build (about 125 pounds).”

HPD sending out reverse 9-1-1 to alert area residents of the suspect description. Younger black male, 5’8”, 125, wearing a 2-toned hooded sweatshirt with camouflage on the bottom. The suspect was further wearing a mask last seen on foot. Anyone with info, contact police 5015000.

“His identity is being withheld because of his age,” Henrico Police said.

His identity is being withheld because of his age. "On behalf of the entire Police Division, we appreciate the community support through the tips called in and to our partners with the Richmond – ATF who assisted in the investigation," says Lieutenant Matt Pecka.

There’s a great chance we will never know the shooter’s identity and he will be released in a few years (if even) due to being a “juvenile.”
