Group Overseeing $10 Trillion, Called “Guardians For Inclusive Capitalism”, Signs Partnership With The Vatican

Today in “news that’s going to give conspiracy theorists a full-on stroke”…
It was announced this week that a “historic new partnership” between the Vatican and “some of the world’s largest investment and business leaders” called the “Council for Inclusive Capitalism” has officially launched. Oh, and did we mention it is being helped along by a member of the Rothschild family, Lynn Forester de Rothschild?
The “council” says its formation “signifies the urgency of joining moral and market imperatives to reform capitalism into a powerful force for the good of humanity”, according to a release published Tuesday.
“Under the moral guidance” of the Pope, it says it “invites companies of all sizes to harness the potential of the private sector to build a fairer, more inclusive, and sustainable economic foundation for the world.”
And get this – the council is led by a “core group of global leaders” called the Guardians for Inclusive Capitalism. We swear we didn’t steal this narrative from a Marvel movie.

This group, who you have likely never heard of until today, apparently “meet annually with Pope Francis and Cardinal Turkson” and represents “more than $10.5 trillion in assets under management, companies with over $2.1 trillion of market capitalization, and 200 million workers in over 163 countries.”
Pope Francis said in the council’s press release: “An economic system that is fair, trustworthy, and capable of addressing the most profound challenges facing humanity and our planet is urgently needed. You have taken up the challenge by seeking ways to make capitalism become a more inclusive instrument for integral human well-being.”
And by linking what appears to be the most powerful people on Earth – overseeing an ungodly amount of money – to the Vatican. Can we get an Amen?
Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Founder of the Council and Managing Partner of Inclusive Capital Partners, commented: “Capitalism has created enormous global prosperity, but it has also left too many people behind, led to degradation of our planet, and is not widely trusted in society. This Council will follow the warning from Pope Francis to listen to ‘the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor’ and answer society’s demands for a more equitable and sustainable model of growth.”
Among the list of “Guardians” are:
Ajay Banga, President and Chief Executive Officer, MastercardOliver Bäte, Chairman of the Board of Management, Allianz SEMarc Benioff, Chair, Chief Executive Officer, and Founder, SalesforceEdward Breen, Executive Chairman, DupontSharan Burrow, General Secretary, International Trade Union ConfederationMark Carney, COP26 Financial Advisor to the Prime Minister, and United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and FinanceCarmine Di Sibio, Global Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, EYBrunello Cucinelli, Executive Chairman and Creative Director, Brunello Cucinelli S.p.A.Roger Ferguson, President and Chief Executive Officer, TIAALady Lynn Forester de Rothschild, Founder and Managing Partner, Inclusive Capital PartnersKenneth Frazier, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Merck & Co., Inc.Fabrizio Freda, President and Chief Executive Officer, The Estée Lauder CompaniesMarcie Frost, Chief Executive Officer, CalPERSAlex Gorsky, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Johnson & JohnsonAngel Gurria, Secretary General, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)Alfred Kelly, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Visa Inc.William Lauder, Executive Chairman, The Estée Lauder CompaniesBernard Looney, Chief Executive Officer, BPFiona Ma, Treasurer, State of CaliforniaHiro Mizuno, Member of the Board, Principles for Responsible InvestmentBrian Moynihan, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, Bank of AmericaDeanna Mulligan, President and Chief Executive Officer, Guardian Life Insurance Company of AmericaRonald P.

Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
