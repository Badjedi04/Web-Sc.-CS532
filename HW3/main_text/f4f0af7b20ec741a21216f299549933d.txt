CIVIL WAR? Large Percentage of GOP Thinks Violence is Necessary to Fix USABy Pamela Geller - on November 2, 2021

‘Once the country accepts censorship of speech, then nothing can be won without violence.’ said Ayn Rand. “Traditionally and historically, the American people can be pushed just so far, and then they stop it.”
It is our duty to stop it.
The Declaration of independence prescribes it:


“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.–That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, –-That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.’

ALARMING: Large Percentage of GOP Thinks Violence is Necessary to Fix USA
And we have only the mainstream media to blame.
By: Andrew West, Flag and Cross Novemnber 2, 2021:
My, oh my, what have we allowed the mainstream media to do to our great nation?
This is the question we must all be asking ourselves in this new, digitally-driven world, where there is no escape from screen-time and no reprieve from political spin.  We are being steady-fed a diet of hyperbole and vitriol that threatens to sink our ship in spectacular fashion, and a new poll has now revealed just how desperate things are getting. 
Almost one-third of Republicans say they think violence may be necessary to solve the problems facing the United States, according to a new national survey by the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute. The finding is part of PRRI’s 12th annual American Values Survey released Monday which, among other things, highlights the continued impact of the same falsehoods and conspiracy theories that fueled the violent Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol nearly one year later.
 

The numbers were shocking, to say the least.
The survey was conducted between Sept. 16 and Sept. 29 through online interviews with a random sample of 2,508 adults living in all 50 states. Nearly one in five, or 18 percent, of overall respondents said they agreed with the statement: “Because things have gotten so far off track, true American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country,” including 30 percent of Republicans, 11 percent of Democrats and 17 percent of independents.
This polarization and its proliferation are not natural.  We did not get to this point without the prodding of the media machine that undeniably profits from their coverage of the more violent episodes that we engage in.  They have no incentive to keep Americans safe, and so they shan’t.
And that is the true shame of the mainstream
