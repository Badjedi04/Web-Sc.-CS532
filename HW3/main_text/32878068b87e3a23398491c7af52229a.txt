Lies, Damned Lies, Statistics, And Murder: The Real Nature Of Government 



“People do not expect to find chastity in a whorehouse. Why, then, do they expect to find honesty and humanity in government, a congeries of institutions whose modus operandi consists of lying, cheating, stealing, and if need be, murdering those who resist?” ~ H. L. Mencken
Political power, let’s call that government, can only be achieved if those few holding that power convince the people at large, let’s call them subjects, to voluntarily consent to be ruled. By creating elections, the government in essence claims power by consent, as voting in this flawed and corrupt system means accepting that system and accepting the outcome. That acceptance, while implied, is meant to serve as the law of the land, and why would it not, given that the people line up by the millions to choose their own masters? If the people can be fooled into believing that such a farce is the basis of their liberty, then they can be managed and controlled quite easily.
As any with even a modicum of intelligence left can see, this entire setup is based on lies, propaganda, and deceit, but the people continue to participate in this ludicrous process throughout their entire lives; all the time expecting a better result. This is true of those that vote and many that do not.  Most simply accept the system due to indoctrination and a lifetime of brainwashing. This of course, is the definition of insanity, and so long as the masses remain in this state of confusion and compliance, public insanity will be the driving force of the government’s success in acquiring and holding power over them.
The preposterous nature of the lack of understanding of freedom by the masses is our biggest problem. This ignorance of liberty has been evident since the so-called “Founders” created this centrally controlled nation-state and their own set of rules for the people to live by at the very secret Constitutional Convention. This is astounding. There has been a steady decline in what partial freedom did exist in the past, but jumping forward to today, all that can be said is that little if any freedom now exists. The decimation of freedom of the individual has been accomplished incrementally, but the continuous assault against the natural rights of Americans has been unrelenting in its march toward the totalitarianism that now consumes this country. This was all planned long ago.
Now we face a total crushing of all liberty at the hands of the state, and few have been able to grasp the absolute urgency of this situation, as most are still of the belief that all will be fine, and we soon will return to the normal amount of tyranny that has escalated for decades on end without resistance. For all those that take this uninformed and absurd position, maybe you should consider just some of the things happening right before your eyes, instead of “hoping” that all will magically be remedied.
