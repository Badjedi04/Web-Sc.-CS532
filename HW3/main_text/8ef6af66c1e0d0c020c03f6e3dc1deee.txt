I continue to question the narrative that COVID-19 exists and that we are dealing with something entirely different.  Yet, a new study is out claiming that whatever it is that we are dealing with, the COVID shots are not effective in the least bit as the study reveals those who get the shot spread whatever it is as much as those who have not taken the shot.

Big-government politicians claim that vaccine mandates are necessary because unvaccinated individuals are a danger to not just themselves but society. They argue that choosing to remain unvaccinated exacerbates the spread of the deadly virus. But according to a new study published in the Lancet, this doesn’t appear to be true.

Vaccinated people are just as likely as unvaccinated people to spread the delta variant to contacts in their household, a yearlong study found https://t.co/2Px9LM5WcB
— Bloomberg (@business) October 28, 2021



“People inoculated against Covid-19 are just as likely to spread the delta variant of the virus to contacts in their household as those who haven’t had shots, according to new research,” Bloomberg reports. “In a yearlong study of 621 people in the U.K. with mild Covid-19, scientists found that their peak viral load was similar regardless of vaccination status, according to a paper published Thursday in The Lancet Infectious Diseases medical journal.”
“The analysis also found that 25% of vaccinated household contacts still contracted the disease from an index case, while 38% of those who hadn’t had shots became infected,” the report continues. “The results go some way toward explaining why the delta variant is so infectious even in nations with successful vaccine rollouts, and why the unvaccinated can’t assume they are protected because others have had shots.”
The study does stress that vaccination has a clear personal health benefit, drastically reducing the chance of serious illness or death once infected with COVID-19.
“Those who were inoculated cleared the virus more quickly and had milder cases, while unvaccinated household members were more likely to suffer from severe disease and hospitalization,” Bloomberg summarizes. Yet the protection did not extend to the elimination of transmission.
“Our findings show that vaccination alone is not enough to prevent people from being infected with the delta variant and spreading it in household settings,” study co-author Ajit Lalvani said.
We should be clear about the uncertainty in this conversation. We don’t truly know how much, if at all, the vaccines reduce transmission of the disease; different research has found different results for different variants and different vaccines. Yet this uncertainty itself renders much of the stated interpersonal benefit from vaccine mandates purely speculative.
The vaccines do appear to highly reduce the chance of hospitalization or death from COVID-19. That’s why I chose to take the COVID vaccine and have encouraged several people in my life who are at risk of COVID to do so. But the fact remains that the main benefit of COVID vaccination is personal, not societal.
This is why Stanford epidemiologist Jay Bhattacharya calls the development of these vaccines “a wonderful achievement” that has “protected so many people from severe outcomes of the disease,” but ultimately concludes that vaccination is a matter of personal health—not public health.
Bhattacharya and experts like him are right. As evidenced by “breakthrough cases” and research like this new study, COVID vaccines clearly do not prevent transmission of the virus. The main benefits are for individuals themselves. Proponents of big government mandates have no compelling case for overriding individual choice on fundamental questions of bodily autonomy.

I spoke about the mandates on Tuesday’s The Sons of Liberty radio program.  We don’t really need the study to determine that these mandates are not needed.  The fact of the matter is that mandates are unlawful.  Mandates are a usurpation of the US Constitution, in opposition to the law of God, and finally, they require two parties to exist.
According to The Law Dictionary Featuring Black’s Law Dictionary  Free Online Legal Dictionary 2nd Ed.:
What is MANDATE?   It is not a LAW! 
In practice. A Judicial command or precept proceeding from a court or judicial officer, directing the proper officer to enforce a judgment, sentence, or decree. Seaman v. Clarke, 60 App. Div. 416, 69 N. Y. Supp. 1002; Horton v. State, 63 Neb. 34, 88 N. W. 146. In the practice of the supreme court of the United States, the mandate is a precept or order issued upon the decision of an appeal or writ of error, directing the action to be taken, or disposition to be made of the case, by the inferior court In some of the state jurisdictions, the name “mandate” has been substituted for “mandamus” as the formal title of that writ In contracts. A bailment of property in regard to which the bailee engages to do some act without reward. Story, Bailm. jj 137. A mandate is a contract by which a lawful business is committed to the management of another, and by him undertaken to be performed gratuitously. The mandatary is bound to the exercise of slight diligence, and is responsible for gross neglect. The fact that the mandator derives no benefit from the acts of the mandatary is not of itself evidence of gross negligence. Richardson v. Futrell, 42 Miss. 525; Williams v. Conger, 125 U. S. 397, 8 Sup. Ct. 933, 31 L Ed. 778. A mandate, procuration, or letter of attorney is an act by which one person gives power to another to transact for him and in his name one or several affairs. The mandate may take place in five different manners, 
Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; -Isaiah 10:1
