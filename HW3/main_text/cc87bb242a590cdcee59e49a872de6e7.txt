President Donald Trump is one of the slickest politicians in our history, probably more so than President Bill “Slick Willy” Clinton. Trump managed to say just about all the right things to appeal to people but when it came to actually doing them, often he was doing the opposite of what he said. In a recent interview, Trump said that “Israel literally owned Congress.”
Not only did Trump state that Israel owned Congress, but he added “rightfully” so.

“You know, the biggest change I’ve seen in Congress is– Israel literally owned congress, you understand that?” Trump told 570 KVI’s Ari Hoffman.

“Ten years ago, 15 years ago and it was so powerful, it was so powerful and today it’s almost the opposite,” he added. “You have between AOC and Omar — and these people that hate Israel, they hate it with a passion — they’re controlling congress and Israel is not a force in congress anymore.”


“I mean it’s just amazing, I’ve never seen such a change and we’re not talking about over a very long period of time but I think you know exactly what I what I’m saying they had such power Israel had such power and rightfully over congress and now it doesn’t,” Trump continued. “It’s incredible, actually.”
Chris Menahan writes:
Though “the Squad” managed to stop an additional $1 billion to Israel in a short-term government funding bill on Sept 14, less than 10 days later the billion dollar giveaway to Israel was brought to the House floor as a standalone bill and passed 420 to 9, with AOC changing her vote from “no” to “present” and then crying on the House floor.

While he was still president, Trump repeatedly stated that Israel — not oil — was the “one reason” the US must remain in the Middle East.

During a rally in Winston-Salem, North Carolina on Sept 8, 2020 Trump said: “The fact is, we don’t have to be in the Middle East, other than we want to protect Israel. We’ve been very good to Israel. Other than that, we don’t have to be in the Middle East. You know there was a time we needed desperately oil, we don’t need that anymore.”

Trump was so Israel First that he would retweet a man that said he was like “The Second Coming of God” and “The King of Israel.”
Trump also was told he was a promised messiah, which he did not dismiss, in the following video.
﻿
Sadly, many of his worshippers and followers actually act like he is one, though they will claim otherwise. Yet, their actions speak a lot louder than their words, and this among professed Christians!
Yes, it is incredible. But again, what Trump never told you was how much Israel owned him.
Forget Jared Kuschner, who was nothing more than an agent of Israel in Trump’s ear, but take a look at this video by Adam Green of Know More News and tell me that Trump wasn’t owned not only by Israel, but by that banksters.
