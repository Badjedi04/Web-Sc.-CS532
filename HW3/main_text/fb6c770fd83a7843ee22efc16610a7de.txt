Anthony Fauci recently said that Americans could celebrate Christmas with their families this year if they are all vaccinated.
I’ll let Helen Buyniski tell the story:
US chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci has declared American families may spend the holidays together – as long as they’re vaccinated. But who gave him the authority to decide, and why are people still listening to him anyway?
“If you’re vaccinated and your family members are vaccinated … you can enjoy the holidays,” the self-styled Coronavirus Pope magnanimously declared on Sunday, in an interview with ABC’s Martha Raddatz. “You can enjoy Halloween trick-or-treating and certainly Thanksgiving with your family and Christmas with your family.” 
How thoughtful of him! But the good doctor didn’t give his approval unbidden – it was Raddatz, sporting a furrowed brow, who solicited his opinion about whether Americans would be permitted to see their families. Who, besides those TV talking heads tasked with pantomiming obedience, was actually waiting for Fauci’s sign-off for permission to enjoy Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Halloween with their families? Surely Americans, known for their independent streak, are more than capable of deciding who they’re going to spend their holidays with?
After 18 months mired in a perverse game of ‘Simon says’ with health authorities, though, it’s not clear at all that Americans remain capable of making their own decisions. The complex behavioral codes of stand-up-mask-up to sit-down-mask-off (except between bites) – and don’t forget to show your vaccination papers at the door! – that now govern public behavior in places such as New York City have highlighted the superstar rule-obeyers, while the independent-minded who were once admired are now ignored and slandered. Only in the world of advertising is it still OK to “Think different” – for the rest of us, there’s a mask for that.
Even as the nation has begun to lose faith in Pope Fauci, virus wrangler (and alleged perjurer) extraordinaire, the spot where he until recently sat in the collective unconscious, doling out contradictory advice about masks and herd immunity, remains vacant for many. Nature abhors a vacuum, and a year-and-a-half of focused training in learned helplessness is hard to shake off.
But that Big Brother-shaped hole in the modern American mind isn’t exactly new – it has its parallels in Dark Ages-era religious terror, the fear-driven domain of illiterate peasants forced to rely on a priest class tasked with holding all the knowledge the people can’t be trusted to read themselves. 
The white-coated doctor stands in for the elaborately garbed cleric, prescribing the word of a Pharmaceutical God to those desperately seeking guidance but unable to read the ‘scriptures.’ Those holy books have since been replaced by scientific studies, which, as Forbes magazine reminds us, are hopelessly beyond our ken. Indeed, forget doing your own research, because attempting to read such texts at all “could lead to immeasurable, unnecessary suffering.”
Is it possible to restore a sense of independence to a population that has voluntarily given theirs up out of fear of a virus with a 99%-plus survival rate, elevated an ill-tempered publicity hound to messiah status, and attempted to strip any and all of those who object of their professional credentials?
Only time will tell, but meanwhile, if you find yourself waiting obediently for the man in the white coat to give you the green light to continue living your life, you might be a member of a doomsday cult.
“Doomsday cult” might be the most descriptive term of the entire Covid narrative. It is truly incomprehensible to me how so many Americans—in and out of the church—have so willingly and so quickly lost all sense of reason, personal responsibility, individual Liberty, not to mention courage.

It’s like we are living in the Twilight Zone.
Does anybody not know that Fauci is a little goose-stepping Frankenstein’s monster created in the downstairs Big Pharma laboratory controlled by the Evil Empire’s Darth Vader himself, Bill Gates?


To use a parody of the women of Israel who sang a song to David and Saul (I Samuel 18:7): “Stalin and Hitler hath slain their millions, and Gates and Fauci their tens of millions.”
Thankfully, people all over the world are awakening to Gates’ hellish history of spreading murder and mayhem everywhere he goes.
From London:
Protesters shout ‘murderer’ as Bill Gates is driven to Downing Street meeting with his gofer Boris Johnson.
Watch the video for yourself.

Those protesters in London were exactly right: Bill Gates IS a murderer. And it may not be much of a leap to say that the tyrannical tandem of Gates and Fauci might be history’s most prolific mass murderers.
I strongly urge readers to study this in-depth report: It’s called The Vaccine Death Report. The subtitle is Evidence of millions of deaths and serious adverse events resulting from the experimental COVID-19 injections.
Here is the Introduction:
P U R P O S E
The purpose of this report is to document how all over the world millions of people have died, and hundreds of millions of serious adverse events have occurred, after injections with the experimental mRNA gene therapy. We also reveal the real risk of an unprecedented genocide.
F A C T S
We aim to only present scientific facts and stay away from unfounded claims. The data is clear and verifiable. Over one hundred references can be found for all presented information, which is provided as a starting point for further investigation.
C O M P L I C I T Y
The data suggests that we may currently be witnessing the greatest organized mass murder in the history of our world. The severity of this situation compels us to ask this critical question: will we rise to the defense of billions of innocent people? Or will we permit personal profit over justice, and be complicit? Networks of lawyers all over the world are preparing class-action lawsuits to prosecute all who are serving this criminal agenda. To all who have been complicit so far, we say: There is still time to turn and choose the side of truth. Please make the right choice.
W O R L D W I D E
Although this report focuses on the situation in the United States, it also applies to the rest of the world, as the same type of experimental injections with similar death rates – and comparable systems of corruption to hide these numbers – are used worldwide. Therefore we encourage everyone around the world to share this report. May it be a wake-up call for all of humanity.
The extent and severity of the long-term effects of the experimental gene therapy shots are largely unknown. But if the short-term effects are any indicator of what’s coming for the people who foolishly take this experimental drug, they might be extremely unpleasant.
Once in a while, a report will even surface in the mainstream media regarding the harmful effects of the SARS-CoV-2 jab. Here is one from USA Today:
Long-term COVID-19 side effects could include memory loss and other cognitive dysfunctions commonly labeled as “brain fog,” according to a study released that examined 740 patients in the Mount Sinai Health System.
The study, which was published Friday in the peer-reviewed medical journal JAMA Network Open, analyzed patients who contracted COVID-19, not people who only received the COVID-19 vaccine.
The most common cognitive deficits the study identified were memory encoding and memory recall, which showed up in 24% and 23% of the participants, respectively.
Memory encoding is the process of storing sensory input as a memory, such as storing a phone number in your head by repeating it out loud a few times. Memory recall refers to accessing memories that are stored already and retrieving them for use.
Other common side effects included processing speed (the time it takes someone to perform a mental task), executive functioning (associated with setting and completing goals), and phonemic and category fluency (the ability to come up with words based on certain criteria).
The study also found common lingering symptoms, such as trouble breathing, abdominal ailments, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression.
Of course, the deaths that are caused by the Evil Empire’s enigmatic elixir will eliminate the debilitating side effects such as blood clotting, memory loss, brain fog, breathing problems, abdominal ailments, fatigue, pain, anxiety and depression, won’t they?
When the day comes that monsters Gates and Fauci are no longer allowed to plague the planet with their fanatical obsession with population reduction and personal enrichment, the families of the earth will be able to celebrate another holiday. And they won’t need a vaccination to do it.
P.S. On November 18, we will print the Christmas edition of THE FREEDOM DOCUMENTS. So, today I am announcing that now is the time to preorder your copies, which will ensure that you receive the very first books once they are printed.
As you know, over the last 18 months, the U.S. mail system has become extremely slow. Adding the Christmas rush to an already incompetent and indifferent mail system means that Christmas season mailings could be a real fiasco this year.
I strongly urge people to order THE FREEDOM DOCUMENTS as early as possible this year. And the best way to do that is to preorder right now.
Here is the link to preorder THE FREEDOM DOCUMENTS.
If there was ever a time when THE FREEDOM DOCUMENTS were needed, it is RIGHT NOW. Again, the publish date this year is Thursday, November 18.
