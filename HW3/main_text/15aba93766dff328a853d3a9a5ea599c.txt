21 Covid-Skeptic Memes to Get You Through the Day – Part 12 

Sam - Admin2 


Kim Usbourne 

Good morning, everyone, and I hope you had a Happy Halloween! There’s definitely been more “Trick” than “Treat” happening in recent times, so how about I try and make up for that? 
Here’s a WHOPPING 21 Covid-Skeptic memes to get you through the day:
1.
Since we’re starting bright and early, hopefully this will wake some people up…

2.
“Look: if a nurse doesn’t want this vaccine, they are clearly a mad conspiracy theorist! Not someone who’s seen the adverse reactions first hand, or anything like that…”

3.
Then again, there are some nurses I wouldn’t want to be treated by anyway, like Annie Wilkes.

4.
Let’s hope nobody had this to contend with last night! Because we should be protecting the world’s children from this nightmare, right?

5.
Oh no, my mistake! We’re going to hold them accountable for murdering Granny. Of course!

6.
Just make sure you’re up to date with your totally necessary boosters, everyone!

7.
At the end of the day, you’ve just got to trust the statistics from the “experts”

8.
Are you trusting the Science? It doesn’t look like you’re trusting the Science enough! 

9.
 One of my favourite movies starring the hilarious Jim Carey. Wait, that’s not Jim Carey, it’s some other actor clown…

10.
Come on, PETA, for dog’s sake…

11.
Probably a good time to remind everyone of Dr Seuss’s wise words: “A person’s a person, no matter how small”, or “unvaccinated”.

12.
I always wondered where he got those mad ideas from!

13.
But at least we’ve got alt-news sites like Off Guardian to keep us sane…

14.
…and you’re in good hands, even if we’re in for a verrry long haul.

15.
Although, I’m sure by now we’re all familiar with having our shares censored on twit-tube-gram-book

16.
That is, if there’s anyone still following us that isn’t awake yet!

17.
At least I have the option to just block people

18.
I’m hoping the government won’t seize my hard drives, because there’s a lot of anti-narrative memes on my PC

19.
When the final judgement comes, I’m confident it’ll all have been worth it!

20.
Funny thing is, I think those updates actually do prevent viruses… 

21.
And for the final (official) meme today, stay strong, and remember this:


And what would a Monday Morning MemesTM be without a hilarious bonus meme!? (This might be my new favourite joke)
Bonus Meme

Stay well everyone and have a nice week!!

I didn’t give the zuckerborg the pleasure- I “deleted” , sorry, deactivated, my fecebook account myself, and it was full of absolutely nothing about myself and exclusively full of anti-NWO content.
There are few human beings left onthe planet, and it may be a chronic situation as Diogenes had some trouble with this a long time ago.

I doubt the page will last long but if you’re on FB please consider a like and share. Let’s try and change some minds.

if you look from the middle-east, you’re put under surveillance and the media teaches the plebs that you are mentally retarded and that you look like a terrorist. 
if your name is andrew, it takes the authorities a month to know where you live.

FWIW, PETA has criticized both Fauci and fellow shill Francis Collins for their horrific animal experiments.

Such a pity they only ‘critiscized’. I suppose they know they can’t touch him so not worth the effort to follow up his cruelty.

Dr David Martin tells us the truth AGAIN, based on evidence. Everyone on this earth should listen:
We Can Act Conference in Utah October 2021:

there is no virus, no Covid-19, no vaccine – it’s a bioweapon, and it’s premeditated mass murder


that’s what we should call it, and we are obligated to stop it

The evidence is solid and David Martin is brilliant but it is obvious by now that due process is not due.
Invoking the law or the constitution will not do much because the terror merchants make the laws and governments have already effectively dumped the constitution in many countries. Any judge who tries anything will be swiftly removed, probably murdered, and they know it.
The masses are more interested in conformity than justice anyway. JFK’s murderers were never brought to justice, hardly any cop murderers/abusers have ever been brought to justice, the perpetrators of 9/11 neither. It will be nothing short of a miracle to see this stopped in the courts of law.

My first idea was to look increasingly like Data from Star Trek so as to convince the unsuspecting public that I actually invented anything, which of course i did not.

Dr Vladimir Zelenko is a great freethinking doctor in this Event Covid. He is grounded, based, and found a way to save lives with by getting zinc and vit D into the system.
Is common flu a bioweapon, Zelenko asks.
Now I sit up. His point is: how did it disappear. Was it rediagnosed as Covid or was it simply not released this year?
Zelenko admits that two years ago this “imagining” would have been dismissed as fancy… but now that we know how Covid was created from the spike protein is it possible that the annual flu has also been created.
If not… how did it disappear? See the Stew Peters show.

There is no “it”. 
People get respiratory symptoms from one or several of three situations: Chronic stress, poor nutrition, endogenous/exogenous poisons.

Norway: This morning NRK, our state broadcaster, suddenly gave the mainstream some facts to go with the fantasy:
So far about 900 have died from Covid.
On average about 900 die from/with flu/cold per year.
In 2017 about 1900 died from/with flu/cold.
I wonder if facts like this sink in or if it’s just water on the goose …

Water on the goose.
The particularly bad ’17/’18 “flu” season around the globe was caused by the flu shot that the elderly and chronically sick took.
There’s a medical researcher who also commented on the correlation (I know, it’s not necessarily but could be causation) between the 2019 uptake in flu shots and the 2020 “Covid” death rate. Look it up.

‘Vax’ is announced as Oxford English Dictionary’s word of the year.
Some previous winners:
2016 post-truth
2017 youthquake
2018 toxic
2019 climate emergency
2020 [None]
2021 vax
There seems to be a bias.
And trying my hand at a bit of amateur numerology:
V=22
A=1
And taking X as 10 [Roman numeral] (a slight liberty there perhaps)
Add ’em up = 22+1+10 = 33
Hits the news on 01/11/’21
1 + 11 + 21 = 33
So perhaps Jim Carrey’s ‘The Number 23 (2007)‘ does need a sequel after all.

Epstein is the government.
The entire system is a steaming pile built upon a fetish of excrement and sack-licking displays of abasement.
Is is not for me to prove. Not does acceptance of my proposition require that I be an “accepted” author or be published in the New York hive of books or the London Review of filter bubble.
My ideas do not require the imprimatur of Oxford or Columbia or the bone-in-skull Yalies or the Harvard ardvarks of the Princetons waving their piece in Bel Air — at every degree you are asked in some way to prove you belong.
It is only when you defy the call to comply that you become honest, trustworthy and free.

The preparation is beyond what most people can imagine. I always knew the capacity to do this, because I grew up in a family that got some attention. Imagine waking up with a dead body in bed and the accompanying photographs — and then realize that is the most basic level. People are already targeted from birth.
If you look at the current DNA collection through the PCR swabs.. “Schwab” being a joke .. all this is doing is rolling out to the mass population. Anyone close to government through family or profession has been watched for decades. Because they only admit those they can control.
Both my parents were vetted. I was rejected (chose to be) long ago.My father was a duplicitous, smarmy, alcoholic diplomat yet he will probably have outlived me. Shall I even reach 60.
But if we can make what the Russians call salyut.. a fireworks show.. If we can find a way to transmit our thoughts to the civilization that comes after this cull. We will have done the job.
That is why I quote Graham Hancock. It is not about right or wrong. It is ideas. He reminds us correctly that civilizations rise and fall — the controllers know this. What captivates me is how previous civilizations left the message so that we learned from them and kept on advancing.
If Mr Z with his MetaVerse succeeds, for the first time in millennia we will leave nothing. The disks will be wiped. There will be no pyramids, no aquaducts, no canals, no Ephesus or Machu Pichu.. there will be a bunch of crackled silicon. What was the value of that?

the objective of the builders of the great pyramid was that it would survive long enough, over 12,000 years, that we would be able to decipher its message and avoid the same fate as the builders.
if, like tptb, you understand its message, you thus understand covid.

True. Galton, Darwin’s first cousin and buddy, was the primary perp of the eugenics meme. BTW, Darwin was one of the richest men in England having married the heiress to the Wedgwood fortune.

Darwin’s mother was also a Wedgwood, as was his cousin and wife (same person).
How awful! You marry your cousin and then discover evolution.

Your doctor should first ask about any real illness you have, and diagnose you.

New Normal medicine – drug first, diagnosis later. It is so much easier that way.

PETA turns out to be more controlled opposition? Well I never, if the name doesn’t happen to reduce to 33 (P = 16; E = 5, T = 20, A = 1; 1+6+5 = 12 then 1+2 = 3: 2+0+1 = 3).
Just a coincidence? When was PETA founded? None other than March 22nd! Yep, it was founded on 3/22 or Skull’n’Bones’ day.
PETA founder Ingrid Newkirk just happens to have a name that means “new church”. Her family moved around an insane amount in her youth – what sort of family does that? A military intelligence one, I would suggest. They spent time in India and her mother just happened to work with Mother Teresa (who I assume we all know about by now). Her father is described by Wikipedia as a “navigational engineer”. It’s almost certainly a front and a joke about how into geometry he was. He’s also said to have designed bombing systems for the US military. Does this sound like the sort of background of someone who cares about life and nature – or an asset?
It seems safe to say by now that if one’s heard of them, they’re fake, a front and controlled social engineers.

That categorically DOESN’T reduce to 33. A word doesn’t reduce to a two-digit number. It reduces to a single digit. 
You may begin with a two-digit number. You may begin with any number–you just add them up. 
PETA, you could do in one of two ways:

16+5=20+1 = 42 – which reduces to 6.
1+6+5+2+0+1 = 15 – which reduces to 6.

There are clear rules for these things.

https://www.health.vic.gov.au/covid-19/covid-19-chief-health-officer-update – Rapid antigen tests can only tell you if you are likely to have COVID-19. In Victoria, a standard (PCR) test at a testing centre is still needed to confirm if you have COVID-19.
If you test positive from a rapid antigen test, then you must isolate, get tested with a standard (PCR) test, and stay isolated until you get your results.
Most rapid antigen tests will provide you with a result in 15 to 30 minutes. It’s faster but less accurate than a standard (PCR) test. It’s best to use them when you have COVID-19 symptoms.

Australia still hasn’t got the message so they peddle this crap.

If you voluntarily take a PCR test without having had any social, financial or legal pressure applied, then it is 100% positive proof that you are infected with
(1) The Conformity Virus
together with a strong possibility of cross-infection with
(2) The Gullibility Virus

When I wrote “you”, I obviously didn’t mean you personally Marilyn. Sorry if the ambiguity might have implied otherwise. 🙂 I should have used the royal “one”. 🙂 
Must admit I’ve had some of the awful PCR tests, but only because two stupid governments forced me to in order to visit my grandchildren abroad. Am standing firm on the poison injection though.
