October 30, 2021 marks a pivotal moment in the course of Palestinian history. It’s been clear for thirty years now that strategy, not disastrous Oslo-like compromise, is what Palestinians must do, and that is exactly the call that rang out at Masar Badil, Conference of the Alternative Palestinian Path: Towards a new revolutionary commitment, in Madrid today.
The liberation goal of Masar Badil is derived from
the only possible and historical solution to the Arab-Zionist confrontation, which is the achievement of liberation and return and the exercise of our people’s right to self-determination on their entire national soil on the path of building a democratic, participatory human society, and building the institutions of this democratic Palestine, as a society and as a state. And that the democratic and fully sovereign state of Palestine is the only party capable of guaranteeing by law the building of the new society in Palestine on the foundations and values ​​of social justice, freedom, equality and comprehensive rights for all its citizens without discrimination.
The Alternative Revolutionary Path movement is an integral part of the Palestinian national movement and the movement and struggle of the Arab peoples confronting imperialism, Zionism and reactionary forces and regimes. It is also a natural part of the international movement of struggle confronting the forces of racism, fascism and the forces of colonialism and exploitation in the world.
The Conference organizers and participants envisioned and voted on a future political and implementation program for the coming five to ten years, inviting “the Palestinian people, the Arab nation and all of the friends and supporters of Palestine and the liberation movements of the world [to rally around Masar Badil] through mobilization, joint action and common struggle.”
The priorities and tasks of the movement in the current stage were set as follows:
a) Defending the rights of the Palestinian people, and the struggle to empower our people to be the cornerstone and decision-maker of their national cause, as they are the supreme reference and their rights constitute the source of legitimacy.
This requires strengthening the comprehensive capabilities of our people through building social, economic, cultural and political bodies and institutions, frameworks and popular and trade union arms of various sectors, which the movement deems necessary according to each stage of struggle, and enables the Palestinian people to protect their rights and defend their interests by achieving their national liberation project on the basis of: the unity of the people, land and rights.
b) The movement is committed to defending the rights and interests of the Palestinian popular classes and works to strengthen the steadfastness of the Palestinian refugees and the marginalized and impoverished popular Palestinian gatherings in the homeland and the diaspora. It considers alignment with their rights and interests essential, daily and constant priorities in its program of struggle.
c) Building bridges of joint action between the homeland and the diaspora on the road to strengthening the unity of the Palestinian national movement as one unified liberation movement that includes various women’s, student, labor and youth organizations and mobilizations. 
Other proposals discussed included the following issues: Popular Unity / National Unity, The Palestinian Prisoners’ Movement, Building an Arab front against colonialism and Zionism and its local tools, Resistance as specified in the 1968 PLO charter.
In a plan proposed for further development, resolutions were passed at the conference to transform the political vision of a liberated and democratic Palestine into material reality. Among them were the following:
