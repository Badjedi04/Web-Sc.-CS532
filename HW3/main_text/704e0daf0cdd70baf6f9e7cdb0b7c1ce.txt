But what surprised me when I first met him is how funny he is, too.'In 2017, she posted a pic of their honeymoon in Hawaii in 1994.'Curious, fun, brilliant...and looks great in a lei,' she wrote.Last year, Melinda skipped her custom post, after reports in 2019 that her husband had written a pros-and-cons list of their marriage.             Father-daughter: Jennifer Gates shared a new photo from her lavish wedding that took place earlier this month, capturing her father Bill Gates beaming at her in her bridal gown   RELATED ARTICLES  Previous 1 Next       Greta Thunberg gets a rockstar reception at COP26: Teenage...
