Hundreds of Brighton revellers enjoy sundown party as armed police descend on Leeds park after Britons rammed beauty spots ignoring ‘Covid’ advice while psychoprat Hancock pleads ‘don’t overdo it’ 



Brighton revellers enjoyed a sundown party on the beach on the hottest March day for more than half a century on Tuesday – after police were forced to ban alcohol in parks in Nottingham due to drunken brawls on Monday. 
Although lockdown restrictions were eased slightly on Monday, people are still only supposed to gather outdoors in groups of no more than six.
But many appeared to throw caution to the wind as temperatures soared beyond 75F (24C) – and it emerged 55 per cent of people in England now have Covid-19 antibodies.
Pictures showed packed beaches, parks and promenades in Leeds, Nottingham, Birmingham and London – among others. Earlier in the day, Health Secretary Matt Hancock wrote a Tweet urging Britons to ‘enjoy the sun but let’s do it safely’, adding: ‘We have come so far, don’t blow it now.’
And visit Devon urged people to only make a trip when it is ‘safe and legal’, while Visit Cornwall said non-locals should ‘hold off on your Cornish dreams for a bit longer’. Cumbria Tourism asked people to ‘follow the guidance’. 
But in Brighton, celebrations continued well into the evening with beachgoers erupting into an impromptu party with flame throwers as huge crowds gathered to watch.  And in Leeds, police descended on a park rammed with sunseekers following reports of a stabbing – but West Yorkshire Police found no-one injured after searching with officers and a helicopter.
