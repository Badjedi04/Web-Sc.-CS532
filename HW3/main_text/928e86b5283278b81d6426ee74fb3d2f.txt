This week, the FDA advisory panel voted to authorize Pfizer’s BioNTech Emergency Use Authorized Covid-19 jab for children ages 5-11. Aside from the fact that children have very mild symptoms from Covid, are at extremely low risk of death, and are already subjected to enough jabs, the Pfizer-connected panel nearly all argued that this would be safe and effective for children. It’s hard to imagine that the lives of millions of children were just decided upon by 18 individuals with ties to Pfizer itself, unless of course, parents and legislatures stand up against this. It’s also important to note that the approval is on an emergency use authorization jab because Pfizer’s Comirnaty that received full approval from the FDA in August in a bait-and-switch, remains unavailable to the U.S. and according to the Pfizer, it could be months before it arrives.
After 8 hours of discussions, 17 voted for the authorization, while Dr. Michael Kurilla abstained. An expert in infectious diseases and pathology, Dr. Kurilla directs a division at the National Institutes of Health. The Epoch Times reported receiving an email from Kurilla that explained “he opposed the specific, binary wording of the question, which opens up the possibility that any child between 5 and 11 will be able to get the Pfizer vaccine. He was also concerned about the longest follow-up for the clinical trial involving the age group being only three months, data that shows children experience severe cases of COVID-19 much less often than adults, and how a large chunk of them have already had the disease, giving them some level of immunity.” He questions whether the jab offers any benefits at all to those who have recovered, and is concerned about approving it to an entire age group rather than high-risk groups within the 5-11 age group.
The FDA and CDC were already on board with this, so it’s a matter of formality to finalize the authorization, and the CDC will decide which children should get the shot. Of course, locations like California already voted for mandatory vaccination of children once it was approved, while other states have been sliding through legislation on allowing pharmacists to administer vaccines to children 3 and up. That said, many states are trying to get legislation through that would put a halt to mandatory Covid jabs and/or vaccine id passports, so pay attention and get vocal. And, 19 states just filed lawsuits suing the Biden administration over its vaccine mandate for federal workers and contractors.

Look at the FDA’s excitement on pushing an Emergency Use Authorization jab on children ages 5-11, while the media spin it as a fully approved vaccine because it is identical to the unavailable Comirnaty, despite the FDA saying that they are legally distinct with certain differences. Only 4,100 people watched this press conference, and comments, likes, and dislikes were all disabled to avoid public backlash.
What’s most concerning is the major conflict of interest with the FDA panel that voted to approve this emergency use authorization jab for children ages 5-11. The National File reported that many of the committee members have direct ties to Pfizer, “including one being a former vice president of Pfizer Vaccines, a recent Pfizer consultant, a recent Pfizer research grant recipient, a man who mentored a current top Pfizer vaccine executive, a man who runs a center that gives out Pfizer vaccines, the chair of a Pfizer data group, and a man who was proudly photographed receiving a Pfizer jab.” Not to mention, the former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb is on Pfizer’s board of directors, who Corey’s Digs reported on back in August 2020 when Gottlieb was making the false claim that Hydroxychloroquine does not work as a coronavirus treatment. No one on this voting committee should have any connection to Pfizer, as this is an incredible conflict of interest.


Meanwhile, the CDC assures everyone that they will continue to move the goal post on what “fully vaccinated” truly means, so they can keep the jabs coming for a lifetime, and get everyone on a vaccine id passport for total control over everyone’s lives. Now that boosters have been approved for a “mix-and-match” of everyone’s choosing, the previous definition of fully vaccinated that went from being after completion of the two jabs, to two weeks after completion of the two jabs – is likely to become “for as long as boosters are deemed necessary (life-course), a person will no longer be considered vaccinated unless they receive the full lifetime supply in their bloodstream.”
A “life-course” is exactly what the so-called philanthropists ordered. They want to see 500 new vaccines introduced by 2030, with children, pregnant women, adults, and the elderly all consuming their annual doses through their primary health care with universal health coverage under their IA2030 agenda. Founded by none other than Bill Gates of GAVI, WHO, UNICEF, and “other partners,” they state that countries and stakeholders will be “owners.” They wish to “integrate immunizations into other primary health care planning, health registers and other record-keeping systems, and streamline use of all encounters with the health system to verify and provide missed vaccines and other essential health interventions.” Translation: vaccine id passports > QR code > digital and biometric identity > blockchain> full control.



The ‘Immunization Agenda 2030‘ plans to “collaborate beyond the health care sector so as to integrate immunization into programs such as education, nutrition, water and sanitation, care of older people and women’s empowerment.” They are also working to add legislation in order to bring this to fruition and incorporate adults into the immunization requirements. They plan to hold all organizations and countries accountable for seeing this through, with frameworks for joint monitoring, and want to implement social and behavioral research to achieve effective delivery. They even have a scorecard. The U.S. and Canada released a joint statement representing six regions of WHO that backed this agenda and encouraged all Member States to do so as well.
Despite the fact that over 91 different clinical research studies have now concluded that Covid-19 jabs are unlikely to benefit individuals with natural immunity, and the fact that it is extremely rare for children to die “with” Covid, the FDA’s Pfizer-connected panel has determined Pfizer’s EUA jab is “safe and effective.” While they all continue to claim “safe and effective,” the VAERS reporting system continues to climb with adverse events and deaths, unlike any other jab in the history of jabs, with reported deaths far surpassing all other jabs combined.
Of course, they can’t authorize Pfizer Comirnaty’s “bait-and-switch” FDA approved jab, because that jab can’t even be ordered, and won’t be available for months to come, according to Pfizer. In fact, the FDA’s approval of Comirnaty back in August has never been available for use in the U.S., yet businesses, universities, and the Federal government all continue to force mandates utilizing an “Emergency Use Authorization” jab instead, while giving the impression the FDA has given full approval. Now, they want to vaccinate children ages 5-11 with the emergency use authorized jab as well, with less than three months of studying potential side effects in children. This is unheard of. According to the August 23, 2021 FDA release, all studies on Comirnaty for three different children’s age groups won’t even see completion until 2023 and 2024. Yet they approved the EUA after just three months.

The CDC can’t even spell Comirnaty correctly. Not a surprise, as they often misspell words and produce incorrect data. This same statement made by Pfizer, was also published on the DailyMed announcements at NIH as far back as September 13, 2021.
Can we finally put to rest all of the so-called “fact checkers” that have insisted for two months that Comirnaty is available in the U.S., and everyone that has stated otherwise were intentionally spreading misinformation, when in fact everyone else was correct because they did their due diligence, unlike legacy media intentionally pushing false narratives for the globalists trying to build our human enslavement system?
Here’s an example of AP’s “fact checking” skills from early September:
CLAIM: There is currently no FDA-approved vial of Covid-19 vaccine available in the U.S.
AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The Pfizer vaccine, which is now marketed as Comirnaty, is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use by those 16 and over and is available in the U.S.
Another example is classic USA Today twisting the information to create a “false claim” on October 20, long after Pfizer already stated they had no intentions of producing Comirnaty for distribution in the U.S. anytime soon. They took a quote from a spokesperson at Pfizer stating, “I can confirm that our vaccine has been granted FDA approval and that Comirnaty is available.” Sure, it may be available at their manufacturing facility in Europe, or even being produced for another country, but it’s not available in the U.S. They then cherry-picked verbiage from the August FDA release to give the impression Comirnaty IS the identical BioNTech EUA jab with “simply a brand name” change, when in fact the FDA specifically stated in that release that the “vaccines are legally distinct with certain differences that do not impact safety or effectiveness.” The FDA even stated that there wasn’t “sufficient approved vaccine available for distribution to THIS POPULATION in its entirety,” which has ultimately proven to mean that there is NONE available for distribution to the U.S., as Pfizer clearly stated just two weeks after the FDA approval.
Between the manipulation by big pharma and the media, the major conflict of interest with the FDA voting panel and Pfizer, FDA’s bait-and-switch on the approval process of Comirnaty, the Biden regime threatening the country to get an EUA jab against their will, and the hundreds of thousands of global adverse events and deaths reported after receiving the jabs, this should all be a huge red flag for anyone considering getting the jab or having their children get the jab.
They are planning your future without your permission. The lifetime course of jabs goes hand-in-hand with their vaccine id passports, which isn’t about the jab at all. It is about full control over human beings, resources, and products. Read Corey’s Digs 4-part report on the digital identity key implementors that breaks down the full operation, their true intentions, and what this means for our future if we comply. THIS is the real battle and what everyone should be focused on right now.
