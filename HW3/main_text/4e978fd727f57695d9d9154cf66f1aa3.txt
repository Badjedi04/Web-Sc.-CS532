“That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” -John 3:6
Recently, Christianpost.com reported that nearly 70% of born-again Christians say other religions can lead to Heaven.
Nearly 70% of born-again Christians disagree with the biblical position that Jesus is the only way to God, according to a new survey from Probe Ministries, a nonprofit that seeks to help the Church in renewing the minds of believers with a Christian worldview.
The survey, which looked at religious beliefs and attitudes toward cultural behaviors, polled 3,106 Americans ages 18 to 55 from all religious groups, including 717 respondents who identified as born-again Christians.

Born-again respondents were identified based on their affirmative response to the question, “Have you ever made a personal commitment to Jesus Christ that is still important in your life today?” They were also identified by their belief about what happens after they die. Born-again believers agree that “I will go to Heaven because I confessed my sins and accepted Jesus Christ as my Savior.”
Despite this claim by the self-identified born-again Christians in the study, however, among all respondents ages 18 to 39, who profess an affiliation with some religion, fewer than 1 out of 5 of them strongly disagree with the statement that Muhammad, Buddha and Jesus all taught valid ways to God.


Still, some 60% of this cohort said they shared their faith with someone else at least annually with the intent of converting them.
“If you think that there are multiple ways to Heaven, why would you want to go out of your way to convert someone to your religion? Of course, you could be sharing with an unaffiliated person who needs to choose a valid religion,” noted Steve Cable, senior vice president of Probe Ministries, in his analysis of the data.
The survey also found that among the top reasons given by born-again Christians for not telling others about their faith is the acceptance of pluralism. When asked why they don’t share their beliefs with others, born-again respondents chose “They can get to Heaven through their different religious belief,” “We shouldn’t impose our ideas on others,” and “The Bible tells us not to judge others” as their top three responses, respectively.
I am here to tell you that this is heresy (1 Timothy 4:1), NOT Christianity.  In fact, it is a lack thereof (John 5:42, 8:44).


John 3:6 tells us:
“That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
If you are born-again (From above, not beneath; John 8:23), you will do the things that the Spirit leads us to do ( Romans 8:14), and what is it that the Spirit leads us to do?  He leads us to seek and to save that which is lost (Luke 19:10).
Let’s look at Scripture:
Jesus said in verses 5-6,” Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God” John 3:3; and going onto verses 5 and 6, “Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.”
Those that are born-again already know and understand that we are to have no other gods before the true and living God (Exodus 1:3) and that there is only one God (Ephesians 4:5).
Take note: Professors that call themselves Christians that bear the fruit of the devil are judged according to their fruit, not their profession (Matthew 7:16; 1 john 2:4).
Remember, friends, God’s moral law brought us to Christ (Exodus 20; Romans 3:31; Galatians 3:24).

In Acts 4:12, it clearly tells us:
“Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.”
There is only one mediator.  “For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5).
Paul, who wrote 2/3 of the New Testament, said in 1 Corinthians 11:1 that we are to be “followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.”
What Bible is it that these said professors are reading? I can tell you that they are not reading their Bibles (Daniel 9:7; Hosea 4:6)!
They have been taught a lawless gospel, a false grace and understand not real love (Matthew 24:12)

Friends, and lastly, the first prerequisite was to know the doctrine (John 7:17): “Jesus said unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and
take up his cross, and follow me” (Matthew 16:24), and in the process become fishers of men (Matthew 4:19).
Jesus said that we are to “ Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:
Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it” (Matthew 7:13-14).
There is only one God, the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, and there is only one way to Heaven:  JESUS (John 14:6).
