Corporate fascism, not to mention total hypocrisy. Delta partners with slave-owning China while condemning Georgia based on lies.

Delta‘s CEO opposes Georgia’s voter ID law. And yet he also requires an ID to board Delta jetliners.

#StandWithGeorgia

Why is the CEO of Delta Airlines getting involved in this? https://t.co/lXPQ2zaUIv

The CEO of Delta Airlines just called Georgia’s new voting law, namely the provisions surrounding increased Voter ID & identity verification “unacceptable”
Which is strange—doesn't Delta require an ID to get on their planes?

DELTA gets involved in politics, Georgia House makes them pay
By: Kane, C April 1, 2021:
Georgia Republicans voted to strip Delta Air Lines of a jet fuel tax break worth tens of millions of dollars Wednesday after the company condemned the state’s new law that protects voters from fraud.

The idea that the Georgia election reform bill is suppressing to voters is a complete lie, it actually expands access to early voting. 
The only thing the Georgia voting bill is suppressing is the lefts ability to cheat in future elections.

Stacey Abrams has urged companies not to boycott her home state, arguing that a slowdown of economic activity could harm the very people the boycott is meant to protect. “Leaving us behind won’t save us,” Abrams wrote. “So I ask you to bring your business to Georgia and, if you’re already here, stay and fight.”
