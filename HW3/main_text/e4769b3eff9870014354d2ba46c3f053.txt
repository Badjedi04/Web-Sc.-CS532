The “Black Eye” Club – Initiation Ritual of A Sinister Secret Society?








Share1KReddit6TweetTelegramMoreEmail1K Shares




Make no mistake, this isn’t an organization of any kind. In fact, the officially referred to “Black Eye” club is said to be a growing community of celebrities, businessmen, politicians & heads of state alike who have all wound up with black eyes.
Most of the sustained injuries have been more significantly impacted on the left-hand side rather than the right-hand side. Although a mysterious wound, the list extends towards politicians like George Bush, musicians like Kanye West & even the influential Pope Francis.


George Bush, 2002

Pope Francis, 2017

Kanye West, 2014
There are many theories to base facts about the “Black Eye” displayed over the internet. This usually ranges from secret society rituals & sometimes towards alien abduction; Even the absurdly scary “Soul Scalping” as a method to replicating alien consciousness into world leaders.
John Kerry, 2012
Assumed to be media target marketing, a more plausible theory would be the existence of Illuminati members been publicly exhibited by the entertainment industry. However possible members such as Kelly Osbourne & Richard Branson are among the suspected club members of “Black Eye”; if true could spark a whole string of theories just based on financial capability & influence to all members of society.

John McCain, 2017
The question in mind is based on the club’s actions in rituals, cults & societies still exist in the present day; provided the evidence they have been around since anyone can remember & modern society still sees it active today.
Modern Catholic masses already partake in such events through pray however rituals feature more questionable methods. Soul Scalping is believed to be one of these key rituals, the belief relatable to “Stargate” that the “Goa’uld’ are a parasitic race of ancient astronauts which integrate with their host.

Pope Benedict XVI, 2017
Soul Scalping is the term provided by Sherry Shriner, author of “Interview With The Devil”. Comparing similarities, it is her belief that heads of state & Hollywood elites are being personally abducted, manipulated and then operated on. The main idea is the intention for abnormal existence to fused & merge with human beings.
As stated by Sherry Shriner:
“The lizards or reptiles are in the last phase of their human domination plan of the End Game. They are soul scalping and replacing all humans at all top levels and secondary levels, even their families if necessary:
These reptile aliens work in groups. In true form, most of them are over 6 “4”. They watch and study the targeted person so they know all about them, and when they take over their brains and bodies they literally can act and become that person. They even do this to their kids so the kids don’t make a fuss that something’s wrong with mommy or daddy because something’s just not right about them. They don’t care about destroying the lives of children. They’re all cold and heartless, unemotional reptiles with no thought of love, compassion or human emotions and sentiment. Those are emotions they have to learn to fake when they take over a human’s body so they can blend in with society as a human.”
The internet will inevitably be a replacement for modern-day television, much as it was for newspapers & radio. It’s believed through censorship & the control through Illuminati members that the “Black Eye” club operates through similar methods & schemes.

Prince Philip, 2013
The most promising of this information is that companies such as Google, Facebook & Microsoft already use methods of censorship through their platforms. It’s questionable to think what information could be made hidden to the public eye including members of the “Black Eye” club, performed rituals or even statistics into the volume of data regarding Extraterrestrial life.

Robert Downey Jr., 2012
However, the future dawns on the fact that new information is becoming more clear to see every day. New information is sourced from across the globe regarding possible members, new ritual sightings & ties to the ever-present illuminate. The question in mind is how far is the reach of the “Black Eye”, what their true intentions are & if the ideology of human beings coexisting with sources of life other than humans is possible.

Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
