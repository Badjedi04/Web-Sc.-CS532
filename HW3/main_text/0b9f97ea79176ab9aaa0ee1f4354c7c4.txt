A registered nurse posted to her Twitter account an image a “string of attached blood clots” that were retrieved from a patient’s lungs and asked, “Still think those jabs are harmless?”
Coolzero17 (aDonna58556659) posted to her Twitter account the image on October 3.
She wrote, “Just pulled this from the lung of a fully vaccinated, Covid +, intubated patient. Still think those jabs are harmless?”

There were several responses in the threat as to the cause of the clots.

Can you prove that the Covid vaccine had anything to do with the blood clot at all or are you just making assumptions?

What we need to be doing is figuring out a way to fix any vax related illnesses. That should be our only focus. 5 out of our 6 Covid pts have all been fully vaxxed and all are on vents.
— coolzero17 (@Donna58556659) October 4, 2021


Prove that these two are linked and then we can worry about fixing it.
— Twink Namielle (Arch Tempered) (@Usurper_of_Fire) October 4, 2021


She had received the booster 4 days prior to being place on a ventilator Covid positive had not had any clotting issues before this. Look up VITT and ADE. You’ll get the picture.

Correlation doesn’t mean causation. Didn’t they teach you that in school?
— Twink Namielle (Arch Tempered) (@Usurper_of_Fire) October 4, 2021

I wonder if Twink thinks like that when it comes to the CONvids being airborne. I digress. For some of us, it’s clear. Health person gets a shot and literally within days they get clots in their lungs just like thousands of other people have had in the past 10 months.
At least one person got it.

It’s not up to him to prove it was the jab..its up to phfizer to prove it wasnt..that’s how studies used to work

The nurse was contacted by SonsOfLibertyMedia.com and informed us that she is a registered nurse.
She also went on to point out that the patient was on a ventilator and “was not ventilating well.” So the team began suctioning.
What you see in the image above is what came out of the patient’s lungs, “a string of attached clots,” the nurse informed us.
She also added that the patient was fully “vaxxed” and admitted with COVID+.
The RN is also battling hospital bureaucrats attempting to do our fascist government’s bidding.
She is definitely one that is not interested in taking the experimental shots and is willing to take that stand against the tyranny, which we salute her for doing!
The nurse also informed us that she is spending her days off researching possible ways to counteract the side effects of the shots.
The Sons of Liberty’s health and wellness expert Kate Shemirani has given some supplements that people can take that should help those who have taken the shots.

However, Dr. Sherri Tenpenny warns that once this is in the body, there is no known way to detox from it completely, at least not at this time.

Last week on The Sons of Liberty radio show, I interviewed a lab assistant at a North Carolina major medical facility and she was unlawfully forced into the experimental shot, even though she had a religious and medical exemption due to the fact she has cystic fibrosis. She suffered an anaphylaxious reaction within five minutes of getting the shot.

This is serious business people and if you are listening to lying politicians, the Mockingbird media and incompetent health professionals about this shot, then do yourself a favor and simply wait.
If you are threatened with termination for not taking this experimental shot, understand that your employer is in violation of the Nuremberg Code, federal and state laws and you can sue them. Here’s some help in that area.
