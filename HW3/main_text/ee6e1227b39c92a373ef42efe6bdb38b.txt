Avoiding the next nuclear arms race
In October 1962, the world held its breath as two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, threatened each other with nuclear annihilation. The Cuban Missile Crisis – which followed a destabilising period in which both countries developed and deployed ever more powerful atomic weapons – is still the closest the world has come to Armageddon.

“Rebukes Russia, China, Saudi Arabia”, WOW, these people will never learn. Where do they get of “rebuking” anyone ? What’s the point of gathering to spout bullshit, meaningless empty rhetoric ? The Russians might be finally waking up, clearly the Chinese have well and truly woken up, the Saudis ??? Anyone’s guess, but one thing’s for sure, these meetings are totally pointless.
In the mean time, instead of my state warming, we’re having unprecidented cooler and WET weather, totally contrary to what we’ve been told the future is supposed to be.

Looking at the latest appearances of Amtrak joey one gets the impression his handlers/script writers/teleprompter operators have finally thrown in the towel and just let him ramble on freestyle. After all, what’s the point if the guy has no idea where he is, what he’s supposed to do let alone what it all means. As a standup comedian he has some merit. As the POTUS… Due to his”mandates” the U.S. does not have a police force, fire fighters or medical help any more. And this desaster goes to tell the world what to do ?

So the two who don’t add to the death of the planet are the bad guys. Well now I know that we have definitely lost the plot and have let the inmates take over the asylum. nb By inmates I mean all the western media and politicians, and some of you plebs still kiss their backsides.
