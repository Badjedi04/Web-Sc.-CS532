Friends, it is long past time to truly examine the entire timeline of this “plan-demic” narrative. Article after article at The Sons of Liberty Media has exposed the true nature of this “plan-demic”; however, there are those that refuse to see. Before delving into this entire CONvid-1984 narrative, a disclaimer is needed. People are getting sick from something, but the cause is not what is being presented to the inhabitants of Earth.

On January 9, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that a “mysterious coronavirus-related pneumonia” emerged in Wuhan, China that could be caused by a “new coronavirus”. Twelve days later the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported the first case in the united States – a Washington state resident who returned from Wuhan, China on January 15, 2020. On January 21, 2020, a Chinese scientist confirmed human-to-human transmission and China issued a quarantine of Wuhan two days later. The WHO declared a global public health emergency because of this so-called coronavirus on January 31, 2020.
Questions should have emerged at the beginning. What agencies informed the world and the united States there was a “new coronavirus” that was spreading around the globe? In what country did it start? What individuals were key players? And, what has been the history of these agencies and individuals? Answering these questions will expose this entire “plan-demic” for what it is.

Some individuals have already figured this out. Yet, there are still useful idiots that continue to comply and submit to that which cannot be proven. Unfortunately, those who have figured it out have family members that refuse to listen and comply and submit under false pretenses.
For those who are still struggling with the narrative, the above questions will be answered in order to clarify what should be clear by now.


What agencies informed the world and the united States there was a “new coronavirus” that was spreading around the globe? In what country did it start?
It was the World Health Organization (WHO) under a man who is not a medical doctor and is associated with terrorist organizations. If you want to strike terror in the hearts of a large number of people, there is no better way to do it than a “pandemic”, which is highly contagious, produces a high death rate, and for which there is no cure. In the united States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) piggybacked onto the declaration by the WHO to begin the domestic campaign of terror with a “pandemic” at the center.
But, many people did not question any of these agencies nor the reputation of said agencies. In truth, the WHO has made error after error as documented by Great Game India. This was either gross incompetence and negligence or it is deliberate. Under these circumstances, the WHO cannot be trusted to provide accurate information. Moreover, the WHO attempted to make “swine flu” a pandemic in order to enrich the vaccine industry. The WHO has not been promoting “health”, but vaccines. A “vaccine” was the end goal of this declared “coronavirus plan-demic”, which has come to pass.
Moreover, the WHO was compromised by its subservience to China. China was where the “plan-demic” originated. China is a totalitarian, communist country whose record includes propaganda, lies, subterfuge, and theft to name a few – an untrustworthy country out for domination. It was the WHO that praised China’s draconian, tyrannical measures against its people to “control” a “pandemic” based on unproven narrative from China, adopted by the WHO.
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) was not much better. Children’s Health Defense has documented the corruption, deceit, and cover-up that occurred at the CDC over the years. In a 115-page report, Children’s Health Defense stated, “Yet while CDC has been given millions, and in some cases billions, of dollars to help prevent certain diseases among Americans, for many of these diseases the rates have not decreased, but have stayed the same or even increased under CDC’s watch. In the case of HIV, despite spending billions of dollars, CDC cannot even report how many Americans have the communicable disease.” The report indicated the CDC has spent lavishly on non-health items, doctored statistics and committed fraud, paid employees to “boost morale”, paid millions in bonuses, and funded a “bar night and manual on how to throw an alcohol party”.
The CDC has refused to address the third leading cause of death in the united States – medical malpractice/pharmaceutical drugs.
So, the WHO and CDC have been totally compromised by politics, pharmaceutical companies and other influencers. Yet, when these agency barked out the narrative “there is a coronavirus pandemic spreading around the globe whose epicenter is Wuhan, China”, everyone cowed, bowed, and rushed to protect themselves from the narrative perpetrated by untrustworthy, compromised, corrupt, and derelict agencies. No questions were asked despite the poor record of these agencies.
Friends, you are now suffering because of those who blindly followed corrupt, inept, derelict agencies and refused to investigate and ask questions.
What individuals were key players?
The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) and those “medical doctors” under him, Robert Redfield, the head of the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC), head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Anthony S. Fauci, Bill and Melinda Gates through the Gates Foundation and GAVI, Deborah Birx, former President Donald J. Trump, former VP Mike Pence, the pharmaceutical industry particularly the “vaccine” industry, the head of China’s CDC, China’s dictator Xi Jinping, the World Economic Forum (WEF), and representatives of various world nations were the key players in this “plan-demic”.

Other conspirators were the US Congress – both chambers, most US governors and State legislatures, Department of Health and Human Services, the medical profession – most, not all, big business and wealthy elite, and the lamestream government-controlled propaganda entertainment enemedia (LCGPEE) along with various other entities.
In looking at the “key players”, most people would not trust them to hold their handkerchief; yet, most have followed their liberty-sucking edicts without question while accepting a narrative without one iota piece of proof. Moreover, the track record of some of these “players” has already been discussed.
Fauci, who has not practiced medicine since his residency, has become the “expert” on the “coronavirus” pandemic coming from the WHO and China. Fauci and Redfield co-authored a report in the New England Journal of Medicine declaring this “coronavirus” no more fatal than the seasonal flu. Their article at the NEJM has never been retracted or updated. Birx parroted whatever narrative Fauci presented. And, all the suggested non-pharmaceutical interventions (masks, house arrest, 6 ft distancing) came from the science project of a high school student whose father used extensive computers at Sandia labs to “predict” outcomes. All the while, actual medications to treat illness – Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, et.al. – were prevented by these individuals and government from being utilized. But, it was all based on science, remember. Ask yourself this question, “if there was a real pandemic, would not doctors and health agencies be looking at any and all treatments to prevent spread, cure the illness, and prevent death?” Of course, but that is not what happened.
Bill Gates, a college dropout and an individual that holds no medical degree, has been presented as the “face” of vaccines. Gates and his wife, Melinda, have supported massive world depopulation through “vaccines”. Bill and Melinda Gates provided much of the funding to the WHO and its “vaccine program”. Bill Gates’ father was a staunch eugenicist and headed Planned Parenthood. Yet, these two individuals have been presented to the public as concerned for your health and well-being. Bill Gates has also planned to release GMO mosquitoes to deliver “vaccines” and use new technology to block out the sun to inhibit climate change. What could go wrong there? The same Bill Gates has bought up millions of acres of farmland while urging people to embrace eating synthesized laboratory “meat” and insects.
The World Economic Forum under Klaus Schwab indicated this “coronavirus” pandemic was the perfect opportunity for a “great reset”. Schwab supports a “fourth industrial revolution” where no one will own any property and “be happy about it”. Don’t forget this is also being used to exponentially implement measures targeted at anthropogenic climate change. Why is this being swept under the rug?
With the history of these individuals and agencies already exposed, it makes zero sense that people would still hold these agencies and individuals as some sort of pariahs to follow. But, the extreme fear instilled by these individuals and agencies, promulgated by the LGCPEE, has paralyzed many. And, let’s not forget the “immunity” given to the pharmaceutical companies for the production of poisonous injections they like to call “vaccines”.
How hard is it to understand that none of this is about any “pandemic”? Is it so difficult to understand that the agencies claiming the existence of a “pandemic” are corrupt, criminal, untrustworthy, lying, derelict snakes in the grass along with the individuals who are continually helping prop up an unproven narrative? It must be because too many have fallen for the ruse.
There is no help for those who refuse to see.
And, there is much work to be done with those who are still falling for the ruse and using the modified terminology while clamoring for the liberties that have been lost. It’s akin to a child learning to walk – the child can walk but lacks the courage to let go of the coffee table and trust his/her ability. These individuals hear and know the truth, but cannot let go of the crutch they have been given by the deceivers.
Difficult choices are being made and more difficult ones are ahead. Make no mistake, you will have a choice. It might not be one you like, but the choice will be there. Only you can make it. As with every other decision made, there will be consequences. The question then becomes, “what consequences are you willing to accept because of your decision?” Are you willing to live under tyranny because you don’t want the consequences that will come with disobedience?
