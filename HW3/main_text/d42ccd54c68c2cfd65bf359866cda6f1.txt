30 facts you NEED to know: Your Covid Cribsheet You asked for it, so we made it. A collection of all the arguments you’ll ever need. 

Kit Knightly

We get a lot of e-mails and private messages along these lines “do you have a source for X?” or “can you point me to mask studies?” or “I know I saw a graph for mortality, but I can’t find it anymore”. And we understand, it’s been a long 18 months, and there are so many statistics and numbers to try and keep straight in your head.
So, to deal with all these requests, we decided to make a bullet-pointed and sourced list for all the key points. A one-stop-shop.
Here are key facts and sources about the alleged “pandemic”, that will help you get a grasp on what has happened to the world since January 2020, and help you enlighten any of your friends who might be still trapped in the New Normal fog (click links to skip):
“Covid deaths” – Lockdowns – PCR Tests – “asymptomatic infection” – Ventilators – Masks – Vaccines – Deception & Foreknowledge
*
Part I: “Covid deaths” & mortality
1. The survival rate of “Covid” is over 99%. Government medical experts went out of their way to underline, from the beginning of the pandemic, that the vast majority of the population are not in any danger from Covid.



Almost all studies on the infection-fatality ratio (IFR) of Covid have returned results between 0.04% and 0.5%. Meaning Covid’s survival rate is at least 99.5%.
*
2. There has been NO unusual excess mortality. The press has called 2020 the UK’s “deadliest year since world war two”, but this is misleading because it ignores the massive increase in the population since that time. A more reasonable statistical measure of mortality is Age-Standardised Mortality Rate (ASMR):

By this measure, 2020 isn’t even the worst year for mortality since 2000, In fact since 1943 only 9 years have been better than 2020.
Similarly, in the US the ASMR for 2020 is only at 2004 levels:

For a detailed breakdown of how Covid affected mortality across Western Europe and the US click here. What increases in mortality we have seen could be attributable to non-Covid causes [facts 7, 9 & 19].
*
3. “Covid death” counts are artificially inflated. Countries around the globe have been defining a “Covid death” as a “death by any cause within 28/30/60 days of a positive test”.
Healthcare officials from Italy, Germany, the UK, US, Northern Ireland and others have all admitted to this practice:





Removing any distinction between dying of Covid, and dying of something else after testing positive for Covid will naturally lead to over-counting of “Covid deaths”. British pathologist Dr John Lee was warning of this “substantial over-estimate” as early as last spring. Other mainstream sources have reported it, too.
Considering the huge percentage of “asymptomatic” Covid infections [14], the well-known prevalence of serious comorbidities [fact 4] and the potential for false-positive tests [fact 18], this renders the Covid death numbers an extremely unreliable statistic.
*
4. The vast majority of covid deaths have serious comorbidities. In March 2020, the Italian government published statistics showing 99.2% of their “Covid deaths” had at least one serious comorbidity.
These included cancer, heart disease, dementia, Alzheimer’s, kidney failure and diabetes (among others). Over 50% of them had three or more serious pre-existing conditions.
This pattern has held up in all other countries over the course of the “pandemic”. An October 2020 FOIA request to the UK’s ONS revealed less than 10% of the official “Covid death” count at that time had Covid as the sole cause of death.
*
5. Average age of “Covid death” is greater than the average life expectancy. The average age of a “Covid death” in the UK is 82.5 years. In Italy it’s 86. Germany, 83. Switzerland, 86. Canada, 86. The US, 78, Australia, 82. 
In almost all cases the median age of a “Covid death” is higher than the national life expectancy.
As such, for most of the world, the “pandemic” has had little-to-no impact on life expectancy. Contrast this with the Spanish flu, which saw a 28% drop in life expectancy in the US in just over a year. [source]
*
6. Covid mortality exactly mirrors the natural mortality curve. Statistical studies from the UK and India have shown that the curve for “Covid death” follows the curve for expected mortality almost exactly:


The risk of death “from Covid” follows, almost exactly, your background risk of death in general.
The small increase for some of the older age groups can be accounted for by other factors.[facts 7, 9 & 19]
*
7. There has been a massive increase in the use of “unlawful” DNRs. Watchdogs and government agencies have reported huge increases in the use of Do Not Resuscitate Orders (DNRs) over the last twenty months.
In the US, hospitals considered “universal DNRs”  for any patient who tested positive for Covid, and whistleblowing nurses have admitted the DNR system was abused in New York.
In the UK there was an “unprecdented” rise in “illegal” DNRs for disabled people, GP surgeries sent out letters to non-terminal patients recommending they sign DNR orders, whilst other doctors signed “blanket DNRs” for entire nursing homes.
A study done by Sheffield Univerisity found over one-third of all “suspected” Covid patients had a DNR attached to their file within 24 hours of hospital admission.
Blanket use of coerced or illegal DNR orders could account for any increases in mortality in 2020/21.[Facts 2 & 6]
*
Part II: Lockdowns
8. Lockdowns do not prevent the spread of disease. There is little to no evidence lockdowns have any impact on limiting “Covid deaths”. If you compare regions that locked down to regions that did not, you can see no pattern at all.
“Covid deaths” in Florida (no lockdown) vs California (lockdown)
“Covid deaths” in Sweden (no lockdown) vs UK (lockdown)
*
9. Lockdowns kill people. There is strong evidence that lockdowns – through social, economic and other public health damage – are deadlier than the “virus”.
Dr David Nabarro, World Health Organization special envoy for Covid-19 described lockdowns as a “global catastrophe” in October 2020:
We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as the primary means of control of the virus[…] it seems we may have a doubling of world poverty by next year. We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition […] This is a terrible, ghastly global catastrophe.”
A UN report from April 2020 warned of 100,000s of children being killed by the economic impact of lockdowns, while tens of millions more face possible poverty and famine.
Unemployment, poverty, suicide, alcoholism, drug use and other social/mental health crises are spiking all over the world. While missed and delayed surgeries and screenings are going to see increased mortality from heart disease, cancer et al. in the near future.
The impact of lockdown would account for the small increases in excess mortality [Facts 2 & 6]
*
10. Hospitals were never unusually over-burdened. the main argument used to defend lockdowns is that “flattening the curve” would prevent a rapid influx of cases and protect healthcare systems from collapse. But most healthcare systems were never close to collapse at all.
In March 2020 it was reported that hospitals in Spain and Italy were over-flowing with patients, but this happens every flu season. In 2017 Spanish hospitals were at 200% capacity, and 2015 saw patients sleeping in corridors. A JAMA paper from March 2020 found that Italian hospitals “typically run at 85-90% capacity in the winter months”.
In the UK, the NHS is regularly stretched to breaking point over the winter.
As part of their Covid policy, the NHS announced in Spring of 2020 that they would be “re-organizing hospital capacity in new ways to treat Covid and non-Covid patients separately” and that “as result hospitals will experience capacity pressures at lower overall occupancy rates than would previously have been the case.”
This means they removed thousands of beds. During an alleged deadly pandemic, they reduced the maximum occupancy of hospitals. Despite this, the NHS never felt pressure beyond your typical flu season, and at times actually had 4x more empty beds than normal.
In both the UK and US millions were spent on temporary emergency hospitals that were never used.
*
Part III: PCR Tests
11. PCR tests were not designed to diagnose illness. The Reverse-Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test is described in the media as the “gold standard” for Covid diagnosis. But the Nobel Prize-winning inventor of the process never intended it to be used as a diagnostic tool, and said so publicly:
PCR is just a process that allows you to make a whole lot of something out of something. It doesn’t tell you that you are sick, or that the thing that you ended up with was going to hurt you or anything like that.”
*
12. PCR Tests have a history of being inaccurate and unreliable. The “gold standard” PCR tests for Covid are known to produce a lot of false-positive results, by reacting to DNA material that is not specific to Sars-Cov-2.
A Chinese study found the same patient could get two different results from the same test on the same day. In Germany, tests are known to have reacted to common cold viruses. A 2006 study found PCR tests for one virus responded to other viruses too. In 2007, a reliance on PCR tests resulted in an “outbreak” of Whooping Cough that never actually existed. Some tests in the US even reacted to the negative control sample.
The late President of Tanzania, John Magufuli, submitted samples goat, pawpaw and motor oil for PCR testing, all came back positive for the virus.
As early as February of 2020 experts were admitting the test was unreliable. Dr Wang Cheng, president of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences told Chinese state television “The accuracy of the tests is only 30-50%”. The Australian government’s own website claimed “There is limited evidence available to assess the accuracy and clinical utility of available COVID-19 tests.” And a Portuguese court ruled that PCR tests were “unreliable” and should not be used for diagnosis.
You can read detailed breakdowns of the failings of PCR tests here, here and here.
*
13. The CT values of the PCR tests are too high. PCR tests are run in cycles, the number of cycles you use to get your result is known as your “cycle threshold” or CT value. Kary Mullis said: “If you have to go more than 40 cycles[…]there is something seriously wrong with your PCR.”
The MIQE PCR guidelines agree, stating: “[CT] values higher than 40 are suspect because of the implied low efficiency and generally should not be reported,” Dr Fauci himself even admitted anything over 35 cycles is almost never culturable.
Dr Juliet Morrison, virologist at the University of California, Riverside, told the New York Times: Any test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive…I’m shocked that people would think that 40 [cycles] could represent a positive…A more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35″. 
In the same article Dr Michael Mina, of the Harvard School of Public Health, said the limit should be 30, and the author goes on to point out that reducing the CT from 40 to 30 would have reduced “covid cases” in some states by as much as 90%.
The CDC’s own data suggests no sample over 33 cycles could be cultured, and Germany’s Robert Koch Institute says nothing over 30 cycles is likely to be infectious.
Despite this, it is known almost all the labs in the US are running their tests at least 37 cycles and sometimes as high as 45. The NHS “standard operating procedure” for PCR tests rules set the limit at 40 cycles. 
Based on what we know about the CT values, the majority of PCR test results are at best questionable.
*
14. The World Health Organization (Twice) Admitted PCR tests produced false positives.  In December 2020 WHO put out a briefing memo on the PCR process instructing labs to be wary of high CT values causing false positive results:
when specimens return a high Ct value, it means that many cycles were required to detect virus. In some circumstances, the distinction between background noise and actual presence of the target virus is difficult to ascertain.
Then, in January 2021, the WHO released another memo, this time warning that “asymptomatic” positive PCR tests should be re-tested because they might be false positives:
Where test results do not correspond with the clinical presentation, a new specimen should be taken and retested using the same or different NAT technology.
*
15. The scientific basis for Covid tests is questionable. The genome of the Sars-Cov-2 virus was supposedly sequenced by Chinese scientists in December 2019, then published on January 10th 2020. Less than two weeks later, German virologists (Christian Drosten et al.) had allegedly used the genome to create assays for PCR tests. 
They wrote a paper, Detection of 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) by real-time RT-PCR, which was submitted for publication on January 21st 2020, and then accepted on January 22nd. Meaning the paper was allegedly “peer-reviewed” in less than 24 hours. A process that typically takes weeks.
Since then, a consortium of over forty life scientists has petitioned for the withdrawal of the paper, writing a lengthy report detailing 10 major errors in the paper’s methodology. 
They have also requested the release of the journal’s peer-review report, to prove the paper really did pass through the peer-review process. The journal has yet to comply. 
The Corman-Drosten assays are the root of every Covid PCR test in the world. If the paper is questionable, every PCR test is also questionable.
*
Part IV: “Asymptomatic infection”
16. The majority of Covid infections are “asymptomatic”. From as early as March 2020, studies done in Italy were suggesting 50-75% of positive Covid tests had no symptoms. Another UK study from August 2020 found as much as 86% of “Covid patients” experienced no viral symptoms at all. 
It is literally impossible to tell the difference between an “asymptomatic case” and a false-positive test result.
*
17. There is very little evidence supporting the alleged danger of “asymptomatic transmission”. In June 2020, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, said:
From the data we have, it still seems to be rare that an asymptomatic person actually transmits onward to a secondary individual,”
A meta-analysis of Covid studies, published by Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in December 2020, found that asymptomatic carriers had a less than 1% chance of infecting people within their household. Another study, done on influenza in 2009, found:
…limited evidence to suggest the importance of [asymptomatic] transmission. The role of asymptomatic or presymptomatic influenza-infected individuals in disease transmission may have been overestimated…”
Given the known flaws of the PCR tests, many “asymptomatic cases” may be false positives.[fact 14]
*
Part V: Ventilators
18. Ventilation is NOT a treatment for respiratory viruses. Mechanical ventilation is not, and never has been, recommended treatment for respiratory infection of any kind. In the early days of the pandemic, many doctors came forward questioning the use of ventilators to treat “Covid”.
Writing in The Spectator, Dr Matt Strauss stated:
Ventilators do not cure any disease. They can fill your lungs with air when you find yourself unable to do so yourself. They are associated with lung diseases in the public’s consciousness, but this is not in fact their most common or most appropriate application.
German Pulmonologist Dr Thomas Voshaar, chairman of Association of Pneumatological Clinics said:
When we read the first studies and reports from China and Italy, we immediately asked ourselves why intubation was so common there. This contradicted our clinical experience with viral pneumonia.
Despite this, the WHO, CDC, ECDC and NHS all “recommended” Covid patients be ventilated instead of using non-invasive methods. 
This was not a medical policy designed to best treat the patients, but rather to reduce the hypothetical spread of Covid by preventing patients from exhaling aerosol droplets.
*
19. Ventilators killed people. Putting someone on a ventilator who is suffering from influenza, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or any other condition which restricts breathing or affects the lungs, will not alleviate any of those symptoms. In fact, it will almost certainly make it worse, and will kill many of them.
Intubation tubes are a source of potential a infection known as “ventilator-associated pneumonia”, which studies show affects  up to 28% of all people put on ventilators, and kills 20-55% of those infected.
Mechanical ventilation is also damaging to the physical structure of the lungs, resulting in “ventilator-induced lung injury”, which can dramatically impact quality of life, and even result in death.
Experts estimate 40-50% of ventilated patients die, regardless of their disease. Around the world, between 66 and 86% of all “Covid patients” put on ventilators died.
According to the “undercover nurse”, ventilators were being used so improperly in New York, they were destroying patients’ lungs:





This policy was negligence at best, and potentially deliberate murder at worst. This misuse of ventilators could account for any increase in mortality in 2020/21 [Facts 2 & 6]
*
Part VI: Masks
20. Masks don’t work. At least a dozen scientific studies have shown that masks do nothing to stop the spread of respiratory viruses. 
One meta-analysis published by the CDC in May 2020 found “no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks”.
Another study with over 8000 subjects found masks “did not seem to be effective against laboratory-confirmed viral respiratory infections nor against clinical respiratory infection.” 
There are literally too many to quote them all, but you can read them: [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10] Or read a summary by SPR here.
While some studies have been done claiming to show mask do work for Covid, they are all seriously flawed. One relied on self-reported surveys as data. Another was so badly designed a panel of experts demand it be withdrawn. A third was withdrawn after its predictions proved entirely incorrect. 
The WHO commissioned their own meta-analysis in the Lancet, but that study looked only at N95 masks and only in hospitals. [For full run down on the bad data in this study click here.]
Aside from scientific evidence, there’s plenty of real-world evidence that masks do nothing to halt the spread of disease. 
For example, North Dakota and South Dakota had near-identical case figures, despite one having a mask-mandate and the other not:

In Kansas, counties without mask mandates actually had fewer Covid “cases” than counties with mask mandates. And despite masks being very common in Japan, they had their worst flu outbreak in decades in 2019.
*
21. Masks are bad for your health. Wearing a mask for long periods, wearing the same mask more than once, and other aspects of cloth masks can be bad for your health. A long study on the detrimental effects of mask-wearing was recently published by the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health
Dr. James Meehan reported in August 2020 he was seeing increases in bacterial pneumonia, fungal infections, facial rashes .
Masks are also known to contain plastic microfibers, which damage the lungs when inhaled and may be potentially carcinogenic.
Childen wearing masks encourages mouth-breathing, which results in facial deformities.
People around the world have passed out due to CO2 poisoning while wearing their masks, and some children in China even suffered sudden cardiac arrest.
*
22. Masks are bad for the planet. Millions upon millions of disposable masks have been used per month for over a year. A report from the UN found the Covid19 pandemic will likely result in plastic waste more than doubling in the next few years., and the vast majority of that is face masks.
The report goes on to warn these masks (and other medical waste) will clog sewage and irrigation systems, which will have knock on effects on public health, irrigation and agriculture.
A study from the University of Swansea found “heavy metals and plastic fibres were released when throw-away masks were submerged in water.” These materials are toxic to both people and wildlife.
*
Part VII: Vaccines
23. Covid “vaccines” are totally unprecedented. Before 2020 no successful vaccine against a human coronavirus had ever been developed. Since then we have allegedly made 20 of them in 18 months.
Scientists have been trying to develop a SARS and MERS vaccine for years with little success. Some of the failed SARS vaccines actually caused hypersensitivity to the SARS virus. Meaning that vaccinated mice could potentially get the disease more severely than unvaccinated mice. Another attempt caused liver damage in ferrets.
While traditional vaccines work by exposing the body to a weakened strain of the microorganism responsible for causing the disease, these new Covid vaccines are mRNA vaccines.
mRNA (messenger ribonucleic acid) vaccines theoretically work by injecting viral mRNA into the body, where it replicates inside your cells and encourages your body to recognise, and make antigens for, the “spike proteins” of the virus. They have been the subject of research since the 1990s, but before 2020 no mRNA vaccine was ever approved for use.
*
24. Vaccines do not confer immunity or prevent transmission. It is readily admitted that Covid “vaccines” do not confer immunity from infection and do not prevent you from passing the disease onto others. Indeed, an article in the British Medical Journal highlighted that the vaccine studies were not designed to even try and assess if the “vaccines” limited transmission.
The vaccine manufacturers themselves, upon releasing the untested mRNA gene therapies, were quite clear their product’s “efficacy” was based on “reducing the severity of symptoms”.
*
25. The vaccines were rushed and have unknown longterm effects. Vaccine development is a slow, laborious process. Usually, from development through testing and finally being approved for public use takes many years. The various vaccines for Covid were all developed and approved in less than a year. Obviously there can be no long-term safety data on chemicals which are less than a year old.
Pfizer even admit this is true in the leaked supply contract between the pharmaceutical giant, and the government of Albania:
the long-term effects and efficacy of the Vaccine are not currently known and that there may be adverse effects of the Vaccine that are not currently known
Further, none of the vaccines have been subject to proper trials. Many of them skipped early-stage trials entirely, and the late-stage human trials have either not been peer-reviewed, have not released their data, will not finish until 2023 or were abandoned after “severe adverse effects”.
*
26. Vaccine manufacturers have been granted legal indemnity should they cause harm. The USA’s Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP) grants immunity until at least 2024.
The EU’s product licensing law does the same, and there are reports of confidential liability clauses in the contracts the EU signed with vaccine manufacturers.
The UK went even further, granting permanent legal indemnity to the government, and any employees thereof, for any harm done when a patient is being treated for Covid19 or “suspected Covid19”.
Again, the leaked Albanian contract suggests that Pfizer, at least, made this indemnity a standard demand of supplying Covid vaccines:
Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Pfizer […] from and against any and all suits, claims, actions, demands, losses, damages, liabilities, settlements, penalties, fines, costs and expenses
*
Part VIII: Deception & Foreknowledge
27. The EU was preparing “vaccine passports” at least a YEAR before the pandemic began. Proposed COVID countermeasures, presented to the public as improvised emergency measures, have existed since before the emergence of the disease.
Two EU documents published in 2018, the “2018 State of Vaccine Confidence” and a technical report titled “Designing and implementing an immunisation information system” discussed the plausibility of an EU-wide vaccination monitoring system.
These documents were combined into the 2019 “Vaccination Roadmap”, which (among other things) established a “feasibility study” on vaccine passports to begin in 2019 and finish in 2021:

This report’s final conclusions were released to the public in September 2019, just a month before Event 201 (below).
*
28. A “training exercise” predicted the pandemic just weeks before it started. In October 2019 the World Economic Forum and Johns Hopkins University held Event 201. This was a training exercise based on a zoonotic coronavirus starting a worldwide pandemic. The exercise was sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and GAVI the vaccine alliance.
The exercise published its findings and recommendations in November 2019 as a “call to action”. One month later, China recorded their first case of “Covid”.
*
29. Since the beginning of 2020, the Flu has “disappeared”. In the United States, since February 2020, influenza cases have allegedly  dropped by over 98%. 

It’s not just the US either, globally flu has apparently almost completely disappeared.
Meanwhile, a new disease called “Covid”, which has identical symptoms and a similar mortality rate to influenza, is apparently affecting all the people normally affected by the flu.
*
30. The elite have made fortunes during the pandemic. Since the beginning of lockdown the wealthiest people have become significantly wealthier. Forbes reported that 40 new billionaires have been created “fighting the coronavirus”, with 9 of them being vaccine manufacturers.
Business Insider reported that “billionaires saw their net worth increase by half a trillion dollars” by October 2020. 
Clearly that number will be even bigger by now.
*
These are the vital facts of the pandemic, presented here as a resource to help formulate and support your arguments with friends or strangers. Thanks to all the researchers who have collated and collected this information over the last twenty months, especially Swiss Policy Research.

“The majority of Covid cases are asymptomatic.”
If so many PCR tests are false positive, maybe the above statement is not true. Maybe the “asymptomatic cases” are no cases at all.

It makes no sense at all that masks can increase the CO2 levels but cannot reduce the load of viral particles. From the physical point of view, given the sizes, it is absurd.

Makes perfect sense. A moist mask causes the wearer to recycle CO2 too much, since the wearer is the source to begin with. Although viruses can go through the mask, the majority of contaminants are sucked in around the mask due a moist mask creating stronger suction flow. This is why prolonged wearing of a mask can make you sicker, not to mention the risk of bacteria pneumonia as well.

It seems that ventilators are used on the purpose of killing people,
in order to collect their organs…
as in UK, France and other countries , each single person is recently considered donor…
Hospitals in USA are being accused, as every covid supposed death is placed in a mortuary bag that even the coronar is not allowed to open, then incinerated …no more proofs…
Already before covid around Atlanta, some particular hospital, people would jump of the ambulance, to escape .

Good summary, thank you. But in Section 25. you say all the vaccines were developed and approved in a year. They were NOT approved. Most are still not approved. They have only emergency use authorisation NOT approval.

They have not been tested on animals, no one is able to say it’s safe then.
( they did test the injections on animals but they all died, so they told they didn’t try )
the contract prevent them from any law poursuit anyway, it’s bankable.
5G gives the same symptoms that the supposed covid virus which was never isolated…

Piers…I’m not totally positive but I think they were eventually fully approved due to all the pressure and controversy. People were refusing to get injected in mass and I do believe that resistance had the FDA rush final approval which many people criticized saying that they only did it due to pressure and did not have ample time to do full approval. Again, I’m not totally sure of this but I would bet a friendly nickel.

No, there is still no approval of the vaccines being administered. Still emergency use authorization only. Comirnaty was approved (Pfizer), but it is not being dispensed as a legal matter. All legal mumbo jumbo legerdemain to maintain the liability immunity for the Vaxx producers which is conferred by the EUA.

It has occurred to me that this is a good time to remember Donald Rumsfeld’s announcement from Sept. 10th 2001. With the Covid narrative failing so spectacularly, illness and death among the vaccinated growing harder to hide, and news that Ghislaine Maxwell will no longer protect the identities of clients, it seems reasonable to expect some shocking event. It is a good time to warn people to be alert. As I wrote in https://markgresham.substack.com/p/a-modern-jubilee-to-prevent-the-enslavement “We should expect more crises, and condition those that we talk to, to expect them also. Even before such surprises occur, all people must preemptively lay blame squarely where it belongs, on the heads of these known and persistent criminals.” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpSBUgbxBU

Sohie, feel free to use any of this:
On Vaccination
2021.12.
Not talking about vaccination in general. Vaccination in general saved millions of lives. We are talking here about this specific vaccination against covid
–         Long term negative effects are unknown. There are surprises and indications of potential problems, such as the place with highest concentration of the staff post vac are the ovaries. These vaccines in the USA still operate under emergency use authorization, not standard FDA approval and lack for example reproductive health toxicology reports.
–         Natural immunity, especially after going through covid – the greatest differences in numbers are not between vaccinated and unvaccinated, but between those who had vs those who did not have yet covid, regardless of being vaccinated or not (for example official numbers from the Czech Rep. show this)
–         Lack of a differentiated approach. One cannot say and still be consistent that age is a co-morbidity factor on one hand and also say that a 5years old and an 80 years old’s calculation of risks and benefits is the same. For an 80 y o, long term negative effects are not that important and also more likely to have covid vulnerability. 80 y o should get vaccinated. 5 years old should not. Same for other co-morbidities.[1]
–         Currently the lies seem to be in the area of the effects of vaccines. Do vaccines stop the spread (1/3 of spread is vaccinated to vaccinated!), or only keep one out of the worst covid hospitalization with a 50% probability? There is a report about efficacy of the boosters that even shows negative efficacy – which may either be caused by vaccines themselves or behaviour of people thus vaccinated.
–         Public / official health advice failures:
o  still completely ignores other important steps that could and should be taken and at times it was not only ignorant, D vitamin deficiency (cheap and very low risk), body overweight management,; instead a simple and single campaign slogan was chosen: vaccine is the only way; composite strategy is the way
o  outright contrary to good advice: spending time outside (apart from adding D vitamin, involving physical activity which is good for body weight and heart and being not inside where airborne infections spread); slogan was: stay at home, (and listen to Queen)
–         Widespread information manipulation campaign. Including censorship and attacks on those who speak out. A year ago when you said Chinese lab leak is an option, one was labeled a conspiracy theorist and evil and nazi and worse. Now the mainstream view is that that is the most likely what happened. I was labeled the same when more than a year ago I asked a question, what of the vaccination effect is not long term, but only 5 years long. Now we know it’s half a year long, or maybe even just 3 months long. Lots of the propaganda slogans are now discredited. Very unfortunately all this made authorities and media less trustworthy. This will make not only dealing with covid more difficult, but dealing with other problems.
 [1] Based on CDC numbers, Child hospitalizations for influenzas before covid were 2x higher than covid hospitalizations, of which 70% have comorbidities, mostly obesity. Deaths are also 2x. 2 deaths per million per year. Based on these numbers, for children, influenza is more serious than covid
Influenza hospitalizations disappeared during covid times

It is good to see you showing the age-standardised mortality stats. I have covered these on my website and on Mises.org. However, you may also want to take a look at a peer-reviewed study of life expectancy. As I detail below, the statistics show that Covid is not nearly as dangerous as we have been told. 
https://www.markavis.org/2021/10/31/covid-hysteria-life-expectancy-statistics/
Regarding the age-standardised mortality stats for the UK, you should take a look at my article at the Mises Institute. It shows that much of the increase in mortality likely came from government Covid policy.

We need to know the description for vaccinated when admitted to hospital or death.

This scenario lends massive implications to figures across the board in all areas.

the 55 years has just been extended to 75 years, as you may know. I noted elsewhere that that formula almost exactly duplicates what the “Warren Commission” applied to evidence and so on in the JFK assassination: I recall being acutely dismayed to the point of some indicators of mild PTSD when I was twelve, reading on the front page above the fold of the L.A. Times that, first, many facts were going to be withheld (privatized) for a half century, and then not much later it was extended to 75 years. Oliver Stone’s movie JFK got Congress to act and abbreviate it to some degree, but, like Covid, it exactly mirrored the life expectancy of many of the perps. Ironically, so many of those were rubbed out well before their time, anyway.

That sends the message that the (shrinking) portion of the population who is not yet overweight has nothing to worry about, and there goes the vaccine-for-everyone plan. The media messaging has to stay consistent; that everyone is at risk, even if statistically that isn’t remotely true.
The word “overweight” means being over the weight you should be. Anything over that healthy weight is inherently an elevated, unhealthy weight. Obesity is an extreme form of overweight, thus an indicator of being extremely unhealthy. That sounds like common sense to me, but to be fair, if anyone came out and said something rational like that on the news they’d be “cancelled” for fat-shaming. 
Health or a lack thereof is evidenced by many things. Excess fat storage is one of them. So is increased susceptibility to acute respiratory “diseases” (which I maintain are simply cleansing, detoxification processes). You can look at one as a contributing factor of the other, or you can look at both of them as signals that underlying health is lacking and changes need to be made.

2. There has been NO unusual excess mortality
I strongly disagree with this statement in regard to the ASMR time series for England and Wales from 1942-2020 (on which the first chart is based).
The percentage increase in ASMR from 2019 to 2020 is 12.81%. This is the largest percentage increase in the entire series! (And over twice as big as any percentage increase since 1951.)
The absolute increase in ASMR from 2019 to 2020 is 118.5. This is the largest absolute increase since 1951!
On the basis of these (IMHO reasonable) statistical measures, the increase in ASMR from 2019 to 2020 was exceptional.

Still though, only 2009-19 have ever had lower ASMR than 2020, since records began. Given the sudden descent of the NHS into ’covid’ policy madness and neglect, this leap seems hardly surprising. A pandemic which justifies authoritarianism it does not make. A2

The fact that the increase in ASMR in one year (2019 to 2020) more than wiped out the decrease in ASMR in the preceding ten years (2009 to 2019) is precisely a demonstration of how exceptional the increase in ASMR between 2019 and 2020 was. 
At what other time in the last 70 years has an increase in AMSR in one year wiped out the decrease in the preceding ten years?
How can you claim that the biggest annual percentage increase in the entire time series, an annual percentage increase more than twice a large as any other since 1951 isn’t unusual?

This did not translate into a lot of deaths though, did it, in any practical sense? It was nothing worse than everything pre-2008! Plus, that sort of statistical analysis looks kinda silly if you end up implying that mortality is somehow obligated to continue decreasing in a linear fashion indefinitely, until we’re eventually immortal, and any deviation from that is all the evidence we need that there’s a life threatening plague in our midst lol. Yes AMSR did fall for a bit, but being essentially chaotic, and seeing as we aren’t becoming immortal, then of course it had to rise again at some point. 😊 Isn’t that just how averages work? Jumps and blips are commonplace, which often coincide with colder winters/hotter summers etc. 2020 was not very unusual, even if it was more of a jump than usual. This could well have been accounted for by variability in normal seasonal averages, and is certainly not evidence of any sort of society-redefining apocalyptic plague. Aggravating circumstances, like elderly people being euthanised, clearly contributed to higher than usual deaths in vulnerable people, but still it was nothing earth shattering. Remember, we do no good putting too much significance in these sorts of statistical extrapolations, based on our expectations of what mortality ought to do in some abstract sense. Surely we’ve got to apply practical, real-world assessments and simply ask ourselves, is there any reasonable evidence to justify redefining societies and implementing authoritarian vaccine passports etc.? If we avoid myopathy, the answer is very clear. A2

This did not translate into a lot of deaths though, did it, in any practical sense?  It was nothing worse than everything pre-2008!
As I understand it, your argument goes like this.
ASMR in 2008 wasn’t so bad. ASMR is 2020 was the same as in 2008. So ASMR in 2020 wasn’t so bad. So COVID in 2020 wasn’t so bad.
My response is that your argument doesn’t paint the full picture. Because there was a substantial decrease in ASMR between 2008-19. So, for ASMR to get the same level in 2020 as it was 12 years earlier in 2008 from an all-time low in 2019, a very large increase in ASMR was required. Indeed, only the largest annual increase since 1942 would do!. And such a large increase is…well…unusual!
You say: the death rate in 2020 was the same as 2008. No biggie. 
I say: look at the massive increase in death rate from 2019 to 2020. Biggie. Unusual. 80,000 more people died in 2020 than 2019. Biggie. Unusual.
In short, I’m saying that in order to assess whether what happened in 2020 was unusual, you have to look at the changes that occurred from 2019.
Plus, that sort of statistical analysis looks kinda silly if you end up implying that mortality is somehow obligated to continue decreasing in a linear fashion indefinitely, until we’re eventually immortal, and any deviation from that is all the evidence we need that there’s a life threatening plague in our midst lol.
If you look at the time series, the trend in ASMR is a clear decrease from the early 1950s. But nothing I’ve said implied that it will continue to decrease indefinitely. And, of course, the fact that the increase in ASMR from 2019 to 2020 was unusually high doesn’t imply that COVID is a life threatening plague!
Yes AMSR did fall for a bit
The trend has been a fall in ASMR for the last 70 years!
but being essentially chaotic
What’s the evidence for this claim? Whilst the ASMR time series goes back to 1942, the crude mortality rate series goes back to 1838. Both series look anything but chaotic. There’s a definite downward trend over time.
and seeing as we aren’t becoming immortal, then of course it had to rise again at some point. Isn’t that just how averages work? 
But why does ASMR have to rise in the future? Couldn’t it just plateau out?
Jumps and blips are commonplace, which often coincide with colder winters/hotter summers etc. 2020 was not very unusual, even if it was more of a jump than usual.
Yes, ASMR and CMR go up and down but the long-term trend is downward. In the context of that downward trend, the increase between 2019 and 2020 was, as you say, “more of a jump than usual”. Which is pretty close to saying the jump was unusual ﻿;)
This could well have been accounted for by variability in normal seasonal averages, and is certainly not evidence of any sort of society-redefining apocalyptic plague.
The fact that the percentage increase in ASMR between 2019 and 2020 was the largest in the time series doesn’t imply that COVID constitutes some sort of “apocalyptic plague”!
Aggravating circumstances, like elderly people being euthanised, clearly contributed to higher than usual deaths in vulnerable people, but still it was nothing earth shattering.
Yes there were “higher than usual deaths in vulnerable people” in 2020. And that’s what caused the increase is ASMR from 2019 to be “higher than usual” to the point where it was the largest annual percentage increase in the time series. Whether an increase in deaths of almost 80,000 between 2019 and 2020 is “earth shattering” or not, in the context of the time series, it’s certainly pretty damn hefty.
Remember, we do no good putting too much significance in these sorts of statistical extrapolations based on our expectations of what mortality ought to do in some abstract sense.
But I haven’t extrapolated. I’ve simply looked at the existing time series! 
Surely we’ve got to apply practical, real-world assessments and simply ask ourselves, is there any reasonable evidence to justify redefining societies and implementing authoritarian vaccine passports etc.? If we avoid myopathy, the answer is very clear.
It’s quite possible to argue that the increase in ASMR between 2019 and 2020 was unusual whilst at the same time holding that there’s absolutely no justification for “redefining societies and implementing authoritarian vaccine passports”.
_____________
FWIW, my own view is that the increase in ASMR between 2019 and 2020 was unusual and can be explained by the following:

The 2018/19 and 2019/20 flu seasons were very mild leaving a lot of elderly people vulnerable to COVID


Moving elderly people infected with COVID out of hospitals into care homes meant that many elderly who were vulnerable to COVID became exposed to it


There was a failure to treat COVID early with for example Vitamin C, D and zinc. There’s some dispute over the effectiveness of ivermectin but, as Peter McCollough’s pointed out, even if you take ivermectin off the table, it became clear early on that there are plenty of other drugs that are effective at treating COVID.


A number of people who were sick with conditions other than COVID may well have died sooner than they otherwise would have done as their treatment was (severely) delayed by the NHS’s focus on COVID.


I wouldn’t be inclined to do so, but some might choose to add Midazolam to the list.

The point is, you can remove ‘Covid’ from your bullet point explanation. It is not necessary in order to explain this minor blip back to 2008 level asmr. Since this ‘time series’ is 70 years long, steadily decreasing, going back 11 years isn’t a lot, especially as the downward curve had shallowed out a while ago.
we have been living in a western bubble for 70 years, very insulated. The fact is this is coming to a close, and this will begin to be visible in the mortality statistics, especially when a lot of people are euthanised.
why bend over to accommodate the billionaires’ very obvious ‘Covid’ lie? I don’t get it. It allows it to be repeated.

I did a quick web search for a definition of “unusual”. This is the sort of thing that comes up.
“Not usual; uncommon; rare”
The context of the discussion in Fact 2 is clearly the ASMR series. As I’ve pointed out, the increase in ASMR from 2019 to 2020 was the largest in the entire 80 year series and twice as large as any other increase in the last 70 years. Clearly that’s not usual. It’s uncommon.
And as I’ve also pointed out, the 2019 to 2020 increase in ASMR is the only increase that reaches the level of ASMR 12 years previously. Clearly that’s not usual. It’s uncommon.
So given the natural meaning of “unusual”, the increase from 2019 to 2020 was clearly unusual. (And you got pretty close to conceding this in your reply of 20 Nov.)
Now you might argue that the clearly unusual increase from 2019 to 2020 was unconcerning given that the ASMR returned to 2008 levels…and, hell, 2008 wasn’t so bad. But there’s a clear difference in meaning between “unusual” and “unconcerning”.

I like your final comments Richie. Point being that the increase in 2020 is made less surprising because of the unusual drop in 2019 (compared to 2018, 17 and 16 which were already the lowest ever).
Good points all round though.

There was a report released by the Lancet I believe, which made the same claim as you are making, namely, that there was a large or significant increase in mortality over the 2020-21 Covid period. However, when I read the entire report, it transpired that there were different rates of extra deaths, and that most of the worst ones occurred in areas that were defined as “economically challenged”; in other words, with a number of other factors such as poverty and poor nutrition, general hygiene practices etc. Despite this, the actual figure for excess deaths quoted in the report, for the whole of Britain, was 1.04 per thousand of population! In other words, an average of 1 extra person per thousand died during this Covid period. Such a low figure clearly disputes the emotive reporting, for this figure represents only about 1/10th of 1%, which can hardly be called a large or significant increase.

vax ‘immunity’ lasts approx 2 months. Natural immunity lasts a lifetime. (New England Journal of Medicine)

Missing Points, file under „vaccines“ and „deception“:

Vaccines: Not vaccines, actually gene therapies, and were invented as BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS, with the financial help of DARPA.
WHO changed the definition of vaccines/vaccination, so the ineffective mRNA gene therapy could qualify as a „vaccine“.
WHO changed the definition of herd immunity as well: no herd immunity w/out vaccination. 

That‘s all absurd anti-scientific gibberish and this should definitely not be missing on this list. Please consider adding these points.

i second that the WHO immunity definition changes are key to add in this article.

It seems so. Most news channels (CNN and the other like-minded “news” organizations) say there’s no discernable reason numbers in Japan have dropped to next than nothing. Which, to me, shows a strong probability that it’s due to ivermectin.

Joe Rogan said his doctor, Pierre Kory, is part of a group that has used Ivermectin to quietly treat 200 Members of U.S. Congress for COVID19. Dr Simone Gold, from America’s Frontline Doctors, told that she has prescribed treatments for Congress. She still believes in her oath, but she is vocal saying she has been contacted by many in DC. Can you believe these demons? Healing for them are OK but not for us. Get your Ivermectin while you still can! https://ivmpharmacy.com

Unreal! Demons is right they are demon driven that is for sure! I can’t understand why the gop is so dang silent about this too? They should be out there screaming from the rooftops that members of Congress are seeking, and getting, ivermectin WHILE they are denying everyone else the right to get it. May God deal with them as they have dealt with others if their hearts are desperately wicked and beyond redemltion

Make no mistake about it, this 2 year old and counting madness isn’t just a bipartisan effort- its a worldwide affair. Trump signed the executive order that set ‘Operation Warpspeed’ into action in the US and has repeatedly advised citizens to volunteer for the treatments. The rest of the GOP is virtually silent because they either sold us out, too, or frankly they are terrified by what the DEEPstate, the DNC, and legacy MEDIA have been able to do with the narrative for the last two years. What’s happened to the perps of Jan 6 is an ominous deterrent regardless of your opinion on the events of that day.
All that said, these people, as corrupt, misinformed, participatory or complicit in all of this are ordinary humans just like the rest of us. To call them anything other than human grants them extra human powers and absolves their behavior as something ordinary humans couldn’t be capable of. A cursory knowledge of human history repeatedly will graphically explain otherwise, repeatedly.
Fact is 2019 was the safest, most prosperous, and best time to be a human being on planet earth 🌍 for as long as we have been tracking such things.
Demons have zero to do with any of this. God isn’t getting involved and no superheroes are coming to stop this or save anyone either .
The only person we can depend on is the one starting back at us in the mirror.
Look at the world… look at what’s been happening in cities across Europe and in Australia. Massive, peaceful, gatherings and protests for Liberty in defiance of lockdowns, and mandates go unreported by legacy media or are dismissed as ‘far right protests’.
Meanwhile we in the states are supposed to be the beacon of freedom for the rest of the world?
The time to stand up, stand together and say ‘NOPE’ was 90 days ago and the massive, peaceful noncompliance that is likely the only way to change this is little more than a pipe dream. 
Whats a patriot to do?
