Capt. Karl Koenigs penned a moving statement regarding the times we are in, appealed to the US Constitution’s provisions for the militia to enforce the law against all treasonous politicians, both Democrat and Republican, along with all Deep State actors and bureaucrats. I’ll cover that as well as one arm the treasonous central government is pressing for war with the American people over: shot mandates.

VAERS Report & Study Indicates Nearly 2 Million Americans May Have Died Following COVID Shot (Video)
Why Does Pfizer’s Own Website State That One Of Its COVID Shots Is “Approved” While The One They Dispense Is Only “Authorized”?
The response from Pfizer on the questions I asked without answering the most important one and that is, is their FDA approved shot available in the US market?
Hello Tim,
Thanks for your call. Below is some background information that addresses most of your questions.
Regards,
Pfizer Media Relations
*
In terms of its ingredients and how it is made, the FDA-approved vaccine for those 16 years and older is no different from the vaccine that has been administered, to date, to millions around the world under the EUA.
The FDA-approved COMIRNATY and the EUA-authorized Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine have the same formulation and, according to the FDA labelling, can be used interchangeably to provide the COVID-19 vaccination series.
The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 EUA labeled product will still be shipped and usable until its expiry date, as long as authorized frozen storage conditions have been maintained.
COMIRNATY and the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine have the same formulation and can be used interchangeably.
They are made using the same processes, and there are no differences between them in safety or effectiveness.
The statement that the products are “legally distinct with certain differences” refers to the differences in manufacturing information included in the respective regulatory submissions. Specifically,



While the products are manufactured using the same processes, they may have been manufactured at different sites or using raw materials from different approved suppliers.
FDA closely reviews all manufacturing steps, and has found explicitly that the EUA and BLA products are equivalent. 
Approval of site transfers and changes in ingredient supplies are common for licensed vaccines. The FDA’s approval provides additional assurance of consistent product performance.




As of now Pfizer has shipped more than 1.8 billion doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine worldwide. As mentioned before, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (EUA labeled product) will still be shipped and usable until its expiry date, as long as authorized frozen storage conditions have been maintained.
I replied with:
OK, thanks for that, but you did not answer whether the APPROVED shot, Comirnaty, is on the US market. I’m assuming it is not since you pointed to the EUA still being shipped. So, to be clear: Pfizer has not put one vial of the FDA-approved Comirnaty in the US market, correct? Furthermore, you are continuing to use the experimental EUA shot for past and current consumers, correct? On top of that, why is it that Pfizer has not spoken out and made clear to the public that this entire process is experimental and the government and businesses are in violation of state and federal law and of the Nuremberg Code to force or coerce these experiments on our population without proper consent? Do they not care that their product is being used unlawfully against the people?
Thanks in advance for addressing these questions with precision.
