So, let’s keep in mind that the alleged CONvid-1984, which has yet to be proven to exist, has nearly a 100% recovery rate, but the vaccines alleged to deal with the unproven virus are only 90 or 95% effective and no one can actually say they are that either given the short amount of time of testing.  No one has really talked about the long term effects of these vaccines in the least because we simply don’t know. However, the unconstitutional, which means unlawful, Food and Drug Administration released information that during the Pfizer vaccine trials, 2 participants and 4 controls died.  This is one of those “adverse effects” government wants to track, but doesn’t seem to get a lot of coverage so people know that they are playing Russian Roulette with Bill Gates’ final solution.

Reuters reported:
FDA staff also said that the trial, which was designed to look at effectiveness against COVID-19, did not produce data to answer the question of if it also stopped infection.

In terms of safety, the FDA staff said there was currently insufficient data to make conclusions about the safety of the vaccine in people below 16 years of age, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems.
There were a total of six deaths in the 44,000 person trial, with two deaths among those who got the vaccine and the rest in those who received a placebo, the documents showed. All deaths represent events that occur in the general population at a similar rate, FDA staff said.


However, notice how the FDA wants you to know that some of these people were compromised, something that those peddling the lockdowns, mask mandates and CONvid number padding didn’t want you to know when people were terminally ill with cancer, had motorcycle wrecks or other things that were definitely the cause of their deaths and yet, all these people were engaged in attempting to manipulate death certificates.  In fact, I interviewed Dr. Scott Jensen, a Minnesota senator, about this very thing, which he suffered terrible backlash for exposing.

Interestingly enough, Jewish Press added:
The information was released Tuesday in documents that were released ahead of a meeting scheduled for Thursday with outside experts who are set to discuss whether the vaccine should receive emergency authorization. It is not clear whether media remembered to mention that four others also died during the trials — and they were in the control group at the time — so they were people who did not even receive the vaccine.
One of the two people who died was an individual who was already immunocompromised before the vaccine was administered.
The scientific director of Israel’s Midaat Association notes that in large clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants, deaths may occur with no connection to the trial, the Jerusalem Post reported.
Companies like Pfizer, said Dr. Uri Lerner, are required to report those deaths.
“According to the published data, six of the participants in the experiment died – two of whom received the vaccine, and four from the control group (which did not receive the vaccine.) After an in-depth examination no connection was found between the experiment and the cause of death.”

That Jerusalem Post article was pulled, by the way, with no explanation, but you can see it here.
Right, no connection. Nothing to see here.  If you have a compromised immune system, you are just taking your chances with this weapon, aren’t you?  Furthermore, does anyone actually think that in a matter of months, we actually have a vaccine that eradicates the CONvid?  C’mon!  We don’t have a vaccine that cures the common cold.  We don’t have a vaccine to rid people of cancer or a host of other health issues.
However, we do have the Creator’s Word in Scripture that teaches us what is good for us to eat that builds up our immune systems to aid us in maintaining good health.  We often refuse to heed those words and then are left looking for something to sort out the symptoms without getting at the root of the problem and often, we find ourselves in a worse situation due to our microwave mentality of wanting some thing “fast, safe and effective,” but only really getting something “fast.”
Consider the flu shot.  Doesn’t really work, does it?  Thousands of people every year get them, only to get the flu shortly after, and then new shots are sold the next year.
Then there is the issue of ingredients.

I have a serious question:  Since we know that we have been propagandized with lies from government, Big Pharma and the media concerning CONvid-1984, why should we trust their numbers about these deaths, or the resulting explanation?  What credibility does the FDA have?  I would submit that they have zero credibility, just like anyone pushing the CONvid-1984 narrative.
And when it comes to WHO’s on first?  Just keep these two items in mind:
