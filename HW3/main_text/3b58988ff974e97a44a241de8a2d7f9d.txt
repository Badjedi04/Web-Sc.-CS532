This wasn’t supposed to happen.  We were promised that 2021 would be the year when things would turn around because the vaccines would bring the COVID pandemic to an end.  Hundreds of millions of doses have already been administered all over the globe, and millions more are being administered with each passing day.  But the pandemic is not ending.  The number of confirmed cases is now escalating dramatically, and the head of the CDC says that she is “scared” of what is ahead.  At a time when the number of confirmed cases should theoretically be going down steadily, we are seeing dramatic spikes instead.  In fact, Axios is using the term “brutal surges” to describe what most of the planet is currently facing…
Brutal surges in coronavirus cases are hitting much of the world all at once, from Europe to Brazil to India.
In particular, the new variant in Brazil is causing people to drop dead at a staggering pace…
Brazil is recording by far the world’s highest daily death tolls, which far exceed anything seen earlier in the pandemic. Hospitals are at or exceeding capacity in nearly every state, AP reports. A new, more contagious “Brazilian variant” poses a grave threat, including to the U.S.
I have written multiple articles about the Brazilian variant, but most people didn’t want to listen.

Either they didn’t want to believe that it was a serious threat, or they wanted to believe that the vaccines would save them.
Well, if the vaccines were going to save us from the pandemic, why hasn’t it happened already?


According to Reuters, more than 145 million doses have already been administered in the U.S. alone…
The United States has administered 145,812,835 doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Monday morning and distributed 180,646,565 doses, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday.
Some would have us believe that cases are rising because not enough people have been vaccinated yet.
But we keep getting more and more reports of people that have been “fully vaccinated” but are still catching COVID and testing positive…
They’re called COVID-19 breakthrough cases — people who have been fully vaccinated yet still contract the virus more than 14 days after their second shot.
The cases are popping up around the country, including in Central Florida.
This isn’t what we were promised.
We were told that if we took the experimental shots that we would be fully protected.
But it turns out that isn’t true after all.
In fact, one news team in central Florida found dozens of confirmed “breakthrough cases” in their region alone…
News 6 checked and the Florida Department of Health in Volusia County has six documented breakthrough cases while Sumter County has six and Lake County has 26 cases, according to emails from each county’s spokesperson.
Now even more dangerous COVID variants are starting to spread across the U.S. like wildfire, and the vaccines were not specifically designed for those variants.
And one recent survey found that about two-thirds of all disease experts expect new variants to render the current vaccines completely ineffective “within one year”…
Two-thirds of disease experts believe coronavirus variants will render vaccines ineffective within one year, a new survey finds.
Conducted by the People’s Vaccine Alliance, about 66 percent of epidemiologists, virologists and infectious disease specialists say they think that within 12 months, the virus will mutate to such a degree that first-generation vaccines will be useless at preventing infection.
Sadly, those that were expecting the vaccines to end this pandemic have been living in a fantasy world.
Lots of people have still been getting infected even after being “fully vaccinated”, and most experts believe that the new variants will soon make the existing vaccines pointless.
That is a completely different scenario from the one that the corporate media has been painting for us.
Here in the U.S., we are being told that “the best-case scenario isn’t coming to pass” and that we should now brace ourselves for the “fourth wave of the pandemic”…
Confirmed and suspected Covid-19 hospitalizations are rising again in half the country, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has warned that the country may be entering a fourth wave of the pandemic.
Public-health experts had hoped that vaccinations would mean a steady decline in deaths through the summer, but the best-case scenario isn’t coming to pass.
I am sure that big pharma will rush out new shots for all of the new variants that keep emerging, and Americans will be strongly urged to keep going back for more injections.
But the truth is that this pandemic is not going to end any time soon.
In fact, right now the pandemic is worse than ever in South America and Asia.  Thankfully, the new variants haven’t hit North America too hard yet, but we are being told that the seven-day average of confirmed cases in the U.S. “is up 24% from a week earlier”…
The U.S. posted 68,566 new cases on Monday, pushing the seven-day average to 66,182, the highest since March 1, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The seven-day average is up 24% from a week earlier, the biggest such increase since Jan. 8.
Is COVID the end of the world?
Of course not.
The vast majority of those that get it end up recovering.
But it is not a “fake pandemic” either, and those that were expecting the vaccines to save us were just being delusional.
Ultimately, COVID should be a major wake-up call for all of us.  Because if a relatively minor pandemic can cause this much global chaos, what is going to happen when a true killer pandemic finally hits us?
If the number of confirmed cases continues to rise, life will not be “getting back to normal” this summer.
Instead, there will be more lockdowns, more mask mandates, more social distancing measures and more pressure put on people to get shots.
This is the “new normal”, and it isn’t pleasant at all.
So many prominent voices have told us so many things about this pandemic, but almost all of those voices were completely wrong.
Now this pandemic is entering a very ominous new chapter, and there is no magic solution on the horizon that is going to save us from it.
