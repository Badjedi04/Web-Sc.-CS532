Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write grievousness which they have prescribed; To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless! -Isaiah 10:1-2
As Joe Biden is pushing for a mandate, which is unlawful, to require employers with over 100 employees to force them to the experimental COVID shot, we look to Scripture and what it says about this wicked and lawless administration to which Biden is not only illegitimate, but a puppet of our enemies. Justice against him and all those who are complicit in this, including the previous administration, is the only remedy lest the judgment of God continues in the united States.
