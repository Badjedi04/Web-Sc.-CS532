“When our veterans went and fought off the tyrants in other countries, were they fighting for the democrats or the republicans?”
“When Christ died for sinners, did He manifest Himself to destroy the works of the devil only for a certain denomination or sect?”
Recently, I received a comment after touring Michigan and the 5 dates we had there.  It went something like this:

“Be informed=your recent touring in Michigan has produced some photos of you with people who are ranking RINOS that put you only one step away from(Redacted) , on of the chief MIGOP RINOS=You are being RINO-Jacked. Either you knew or you didn’t but now for sure you do. Do your homework and get more info=fb group RINO HUNTERS is a good place to start. I would rather you would have me inside the tent pissing out, than outside pissing in” (Sorry for expletive – Colossians 3:8)
Of course, I responded with I am a preacher not an appeaser, that I am called to seek and to save that which is lost regardless of who they are, or of that which they are a part (Luke 19:10).


No wonder why people are divided (Mark 3:25). They are ignorant of the Word of God and their own founding documents (Hosea 4:6).
Theses grown-ups are caught up into their favorite politicians and their favorite party affiliations that we were, and are, warned to stay away from (Party affiliations are unbiblical).
They are playing into the ends of their enemies.


The natural first (1 Corinthians 2:14).
When you look to those who fight for our freedoms (John 15:13), are they fighting for the unconstitutional republicans or for the unconstitutional democrats? Neither.
They are fighting to uphold the law (Article VI, Section 2 U.S. Constitution) against all enemies both foreign and domestic, aren’t they (Isaiah 42:21, 51:4)?
How is it that the people in this country don’t understand the simplicity of what I just shared (Mark 18:3)?
Those that represent us in government capacity are to do the same thing.  They are to magnify the law, not their favorite party affiliations that divide us.  To continue on with this deception would be willfully blinding yourselves to the truth of the matter.
Now, to the spiritual.
Let me ask those who refuse to acknowledge the truth of the matter: Is Christ divided?
“Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.
Now this I say, that every one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.
Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?” 1 Corinthians 1:10,13
Ephesians 4:4-6 tells us:
“There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; One Lord, one faith, one baptism, One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.”
We are to follow and unify under Christ and Him alone (John 14:6), and in doing so, this will unite us and separate us from unbiblical denomination affiliations.


Friends, either we are going to get this right under God or it will be divided that we fall (Psalm 33:12).
Which do you prefer?
