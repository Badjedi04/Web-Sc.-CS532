The mainstream media has finally caught on that the supply shortage and hyperinflation will mean that Thanksgiving will be “lacking” and expense for the items you can find. Overall, the media claims that this year’s Thanksgiving will cost 4-5% more than last year’s, however, we wager it’s higher than that.
“When you go to the grocery store and it feels more expensive, that’s because it is,” said Veronica Nigh, senior economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation. Food prices are up 3.7% so far in 2021, versus a 20-year average of about 2.4%, she told CBS MoneyWatch. 
As a result, the overall tab for turkey and all the trimmings will cost 4% to 5% more this year than a year ago. According to the Farm Bureau, in 2020 the cost of preparing the holiday feast came to just under $47 (for 10 people or less) — the lowest level since 2010. –CBS News
They claim you will be paying more for your Thanksgiving dinner, but you will be able to get everything you need. Based on real images of empty shelves that have been seen all over the United States, we highly doubt that’s truthful. Of course, when is the mainstream media truthful and anything other than propaganda?
“You might pay more for it than you want, but you will be able to find it,” said Nigh.  Turkey hatchery estimates from the U.S. Department of Agriculture point to “a very normal production year for turkeys,” she said. She said that the turkeys will be bigger though. How do we think that’s going to happen? Perhaps some injections or modifications? Perhaps. Just really look at the quality of the turkey you are purchasing.  “If you can’t raise more turkeys, raise turkeys that are a little fatter,” Nigh said.

Just remember to look around, notice shrinkflation, inflation, and what is missing from your local stores. This will help guide you to the right items to get now before the shopping craze for the holidays hits. Make your list and start getting items now if you intend to put on a full Thanksgiving event.  It can be done, but it may take some preparation this year. Either way, don’t let the sociopaths controlling this food shortage to get you down.
