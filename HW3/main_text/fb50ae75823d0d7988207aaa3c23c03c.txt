Tony Abbott says ‘every extreme weather event’ in Australia is being used as ‘proof of climate change’ by eco fanatics who have become ‘religious’ in their beliefs 


‘Tony Abbott says climate change zealots are wrongly using ‘every extreme weather event’ as undeniable proof of global warming, with the former prime minister denying it was the main cause of Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis.
Mr Abbott launched a stinging rebuke of eco warriors at an event for the Heritage Foundation, a right-wing think tank, in Washington D.C. on Tuesday – where he also lauded US President Donald Trump‘s first term in office.
The former Liberal Party leader and volunteer firefighter said deadly bushfires were inevitable in Australia and pointed to the century-old Dorothea Mackeller poem ‘My Country’ which describes the country as a land ‘of droughts and flooding rains’.
